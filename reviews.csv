4,Does the Job without Frills,"Easy to set, easy to use and the alarm that starts low and gets louder is PERFECT for sleepers like me.  It's like the old days, again as it's easy to set and use with none of the frills most people want today.  Price was good as well.  The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is because it doesn't work on an AM or PM mode, if you want to get up at 8:00 whether AM or in the PM, you must as an example hit the alarm button at 9:00 or else the alarm with ring anytime within that hour - you'll see what I mean if you buy this.  I still love it as it's perfect to get me up and moving.",1676753204734,0,true

5,As described. Quiet compared to other ones. Easy to fill.,"This humidifier works well so far. Considering some of the reviews, pretty quiet operation. Reservoir does last for a long time if ran at lower output setting (logical). Not obvious in the room compared to decor. No light in the lower priced model. Auto shutoff worked fine. As described. Hope it lasts for a while.",1673889905847,2,true

5,averted a kitchen mishap!,"I reach up onto the top shelf of my pantry with wet hands and grabbed one of the tallest containers.  The container slipped from my wet hands and tumbled to the kitchen floor .  I expected to see the container off load its cargo of dry rice, scattering for days over and under everything.  But that wasn't what happened at all.  Container intact, lid firmly gripping the top.  Rice remained safely within the container.  Buy this and you won't  regret.<br />  Also comes with 4/5 , I forget, quarter sheets of stickers and a white marking pen.  Unbelievable.",1675385347238,7,true

5,"Deep tissue massage, easy to use!",This is one of the bests massage guns I have ever used. Iruntek has one of the most powerful machines on the market which really gets into a deep tissue massage mode. I have had shoulder/upper back pain for years and I can really get into the place that I need it most. I love the handle as I am able to do most of the massaging myself since has a tilt feature (I don't need to bother my husband). Loads of varying speeds and changeable heads so I can tailor make each massage for my own personal needs. Highly recommend this Iruntek for anyone looking for a great massage gun.,1674495756594,0,false
5,Great way to store your kpods without using much space!,"My brother bought me a small Keurig machine for Christmas. I really liked it because it was small and since I have extremely limited space here. I saw this kcup holder and I loved the idea that I could handily store the pods right at the machine without taking up additional space. This was extremely easily to install and holds all the pods easily (and they are easy to remove and replace).  Highly recommend this especially for someone, like me, with limited counter space.",1673197187326,0,false

1,Oneida Dover Silverware not quality controlled,"I needed to replace my Oneida Marquette 18/10 Silverware. I had it for 25 years and my daughter threw forks and spoons away as she was growing up. I did not notice until I had 3 teaspoons and 5 forks out of a set of 12. So I picked out Oneida Dover, it goes really nicely with my Mikasa Remembrance fine china. I ordered the 45 piece set it comes with some serving pieces. As you will see in the photos, there were problems. Salad Forks, Dinner Forks, Knifes, Diner Spoons and teaspoons all had missing or smuggled flowers on the handles. I called Oneida customer service. They said they are not aware of the problems. I sent them the photos and they checked there stock and found the same problems. They told me to call Amazon and return the silverware. This set was made in Indonesia. I am hoping in a few months the problem will be fix. If you look at Macy's the reviews are the same thing. Since November 2022 there is this problem.  Oneida was sold to Lenox and Lenox was sold to someone else. The Molding/stamping has gone down hill.",1677190787660,0,true
2,"Tiny, hard to get ice out.","When I read this was small ice cube tray, I was expecting the ice cube holes to be small, but the entire thing is small. It will probably take all 3 to fill up my glass. I froze one to try it out,and it took forever to get the ice out of those tiny holes. My hands were freezing when I finished.

5,Comfortable,"My sister loves it! It didn't need to sit for 72 hours after opening, but we did it anyway. It is very high matress, sits up much higher than her old one. Very comfortable to her. I have to have a very soft bed. I tried this one of hers, and it's firm to me. It has a 4 inch topper on it, and it still feels firm to me. You don't sink in this matress, you are laying on top of it(if that makes sense). It's fine for her, but I wouldn't buy this for myself.",1676781255636,0,true

4,It will do the job I guess,"I ended up returning but if you need a coffee pot, it will do the job. I just didn't like how it was made of cheap plastic. I don't like how you have to remove the water reservoir lid to add water. I would've liked a flip up type lid.  It will work fine if you need one, I just personally wanted something better made that's about the same price",1675362519138,2,true

4,Took me a while to figure out how to do it so it would hang,"This was my first time using one of this & it was a little hard for me to figure out. If you are doing a straight garland, I would put the strip up first and put a balloon in every couple of holes & then go back & fill in as needed. If you are doing big clusters, you could put balloons in first, or hang strip first, but I would still do every other hole because it makes it too full to manage with every hole filled before hanging.",1674813454801,0,true

5,Great coffee canister!,"Got this yesterday & was so impressed with the quality that I had to write a review. This canister, along with the travel canister & scoop are a great deal. The size is perfect for the countertop. I was expecting the travel canister to be larger, but it's just so darn cute that I can't complain. The travel canister holds a few ounces, so I use it for storing my amber sugar.<br /><br />I highly recommend this for all you coffee lovers out there. Great price & quality product...I'll be purchasing another for loose tea!",1677945662784,0,true
5,wooden clothes pins,"I use these wooden clothes pins for chip clips.  And these particular clothes pins are really good.  They are long and the pinch is strong.

3,"9x13"" pans, NOT heavy duty","9x13"" so called 'heavy duty' aluminum pans. They are not what I would call heavy duty in any way.  I did use 2 on the casseroles I was making in order to be able to lift them in and out of the oven.  If you're using for something that weighs less than 1/2"" lb, you're probably ok.  But not if you're planning to make casseroles or ANYTHING with any weight.  They do come with foil lids, which, in my opinion, pretty good quality.  Can be pinched around the pan with a decent closure.  Still, they should not be called  'heavy duty.'  Having said all of this, I never hesitate to update my reviews should new info seem useful.

5,Mueller 4 slice toaster,"Mueller 4 slice toaster.  I think this is one of the best toasters I have ever purchased.  Perfectly cooked toast.  Every time.  I like a medium color, not light, not burnt.  Of course the color is adjustable.  Adjustable for toast, bagels and pastries. Very efficient, even when used repeatedly.  Each time, perfectly done.  Time will of course tell.  The outer shell is stainless, toast 'pops' easily. Having said all of this, I never hesitate to update my reviews should new info seem useful.

5,silicone egg poacher cups,"Silicone egg poaching cups - you get 4, multi color cups.  They are flimsy - they are silicone and thin so that your eggs can poach in a reasonable time!  I used my small sauce pan - so it sort of helped keep the cups upright, put a tiny cube of butter in each cup (my preference, great for taste and helps with the cleaning too) and then added about 1 1/2"" water into the pan.  The cups floated a tiny bit - but are held pretty well by the size of sauce pan.  You MUST use a lid.  I don't do super juicy eggs - so in about 5 minutes I had 'gel' yolk eggs - PERFECT - to me. Win!  I read a review that mentioned you don't want to wash in the dishwasher as they absorb the soap flavor, so I hand wash them - which was easy.  Honestly this cooked a perfect poached egg for me.  I would recommend them.  It does come with a cheapy oil brush - but my husband loves to 'brush pans' with a little oil when he cooks, so it'll last a little while I'm sure - it's just small and flimsy.",1676226075507,5,true
3,handcrank grater,"This grater works... on soft stuff.  3 wheels, coarse shred, fine shred and one that wide, thin slices like cucumbers or zucchini.

The other thing is - the handles - I have a love/hate thing going on with those.  They are so handy when you need to carry them, take them in and out of the oven - the bummer, is trying to tote them around - in a cooler, or other.  The handles just get in the way!

HOWEVER, it's as close as you're going to get.  It's easy to pull the spray trigger.  Two 'fan' sprays are 1/4 tsp - at it appears close.  You can chose a fan like spray or a stream.  I use the fan. I have 2 sprayers, one for avocado oil (higher smoke point) and the other for olive oil.  It's so nice not to finally have a sprayer that works.  Granted, I have only just used them for a couple of weeks, so time will tell.  I hand washed them to be sure I got all the nooks and cranys, easy.  I really love the fan spray of both the avocado and olive oils.  I say it's worth a try, just one more...  Having said all of this, I never hesitate to update my reviews should new info seem useful.

5,Tebery 3 pk stainless steel rectangle divided plates,"3 pk of  stainless steel rectangle divided plates.  I purchased these because I love to make bento boxes, but, washing the delicate bento trays is a little bit of a pain.  These are stainless steel trays are awesome!  They wash in the dishwasher - top or bottom rack! Easy peezy clean up.  They look a little - less refined, and create a more let's say - industrial bento trays - but I like it.  Especially when I know I don't have to do anything but rinse and toss in the dishwasher.  They are great!  The metal material is heavy in my opinion. The edges are rolled so there are no sharp edges.  And have 5 sections for your bento choices. Or, you can keep all your food separate.  I like these - but they do look 'industrial' and not 'fine art' by any means in my opinion!  Bon Apetite!  Having said all of this, I never hesitate to update my reviews should new info seem useful.

5,Mezzaluna knife with protective cover,"This is a very sharp and effective mezzaluna knife.  You definitely need to keep track of the protective shield.  So as you're washing, don't lose the protective shield.  I always hand wash my knives and this is one is a handwasher, in my opinion - in order to keep the edge sharp longer.

5,Stainless steel ricer,"I just riced some russet potatoes for mashers. This ricer work nicely.  They were fluffy and creamy.  Perfect. You want to make sure you don't overload the carriage.  And squeezing the arm and carriage takes a pretty strong hand.  In fact, I used both of my hands - and got it done.  The arms have a nice silicone, or like, covering to help make them not slide out of your hands and to also help you grip them better.  It appears to be stainless steel.  I wash it in the dishwasher and it cleans perfectly.  I had purchased one that you 'spin' using the handle, but it worked horribly.  It didn't rice and it was difficult to assemble and disassemble to clean.  So I wholeheartedly recommend this one.   Having said all of this, I never hesitate to update my reviews should new info seem useful.

5,automatic salt and pepper with charger station and WHITE LIGHT,"These automatic salt and pepper with charger station - with WHITE LIGHT.  I bought a different brand it had blue lights, which is actually worse than no light at all!  So it is SOOOO good to have the white light in these - you can actually SEE the salt and pepper on what you're seasoning.  Further, the salt and peppercorn reservoirs are WAY larger in this set than the others.  And even more, they are 'automatic,' so, they turn on as you turn them over.  This also means that when they are sitting on the charger station they are charging and not on the opening, so they stay clean!  Honestly, I really wish that I would have purchased this set first!

5,Quilted fitted mattress pad,"Purchased this quilted pad to replace a worn one.  It is thick and soft.  It washed and dried very nicely.  The sides are a thinner, stretchy nylon material with an elastic edge to fit most any mattress, even really thick ones.  I think it says up to 21"".  So it should be good unless you have a really thin mattress.  This is on an adjustable bed, so it needs to be flexible and it is. A good purchase in my opinion.

5,Bamboo recipe card holder,"I am one of those people who still writes recipes that I see on social media - etc in order to save memory on my phone!  I ran out of room in my older, very full holder, so I purchased this one.  It appears to be bamboo, which is sustainable so I like that.  There is a groove on the top of the box that will hold a recipe card if you're in to that ( I cover mine with  protector films and wander around the kitchen with them) and also an interesting knob at the bottom that slides in and out of the bottom of the box.  It's grooved widely and holds your phone if you're watching a media recipe.  Not sure if I will ever use that - but it's interesting.  This box does not come with any dividers, so you'll need to purchase those, your recipes card and protective covers if you like.  It is literally just the box.  Period. It fits a 4x6 card.

2,"rechargable salt and pepper shakers, blue light","I purchased these rechargable salt and pepper shakers because they came with a charging pad and LED lights. I have 2 rechargable shakers now that I must plug into a USB cord every few weeks - but no light. The problem with these is that the light is BLUE.  It's almost worse than NO light because the blue light is so blue you can't see where or what you are grinding!  The charge pad is handy, but you'll be constantly cleaning it because your shakers sit on the charger base - at the bottoms where the salt and pepper exit.  Also, you must press the button to grind - my current shakers turn on when you flip them - there is a button but no one uses it.  Additionally, the reservoirs for the peppercorns and salt crystals are VERY small.  Eh.  Minus 2 stars for the horrible blue light and another star dock for the way they are designed with the grinder opening on the charger base.  I am searching for a better set, at the very least with a white light.  I cannot recommend this set.  Not sure what I will do with them, probably donate them.

4,Great Decorator Item,"I was hoping to pass this on to a child as a truck to play with after I enjoyed having it for a while.  Unfortunately, it is not suitable for play, as the wheels are fixed and do not move.  Also it has some sharp edges that a child could get hurt on.  They did put real rubber tires on this, so that makes it look more realistic.  Suitable mainly as a decorative item.  Would make a nice centerpiece for a table and you could use the truck bed for napkins (if folded a certain way) or for a few condiments, such as a salt and pepper shaker.  The truck has enough detail to be attractive and interesting, such as side mirrors and a steering wheel.  I knocked off one star on my rating just because the wheels are fixed in place.

5,Cute !!,I have been collecting plant heads for a while and I really like these. There are so cute. They are nice and small and fit on any shelf Or plant area. I have only 1 issue With 1 of them being a bit wobbly and not as sturdy as the other 2 it has a tendency to be top heavy and sometimes fall back.

4,Looks very retro,"Most of the items in my kitchen are white including my old dish rack. This 1 is a black metal. My old 1 was metal Underneath with a white Rubberized coating. Old 1 was cracked where the coding came off The metal began to rust and 1 of the holders for the silverware cup was broken so So it was time for a new 1. I decided on this 1 because it had 2 Racks And I thought that might be different and better. Everything is detachable you get 1Cup holder that holds about 5 cups I think And can be put on either of the racks. Then it has the silverware holder which is square And has 3 compartments And it's made out of a metal mesh. When I do my silverware I always put the eating side up But with this rack It has bars that go straight across on the front and sides and my silverware kept slipping through So I have to put on the opposite way which was just something different to learn. This rack is also little smaller Which was okay, So I had to configure where to put Items like my coffee cups how the plates would stand in the larger 1And have the bowls we're gonna go. Eventually I figured it out and it's a niceEventually I figured it out and it's a nice dish rack. Its a good quality and I hope it lasts a long time.",1677962973676,0,false

He lives in an assisted living place and outside all of the apartments, there's a little shelf. Most of the residents put some kind of holiday decorations on theirs, so that's what I've been doing for Dad. These are wooden. There is a little assembly required, but it's just a matter of putting the stand piece on the rabbits. The pieces are simple and sort of rustic looking, but they are very cute. Plus, they store flat when you remove the stands which is really important since Dad has limited space in his apartment. I'm really picking about the decor I use in my own home.

3,Finally! A mattress pad that actually heats up!,"PROS: 1. A pad that actually heats up! I live in Wisconsin and we actually have winter, sometimes 20 below without wind chill! I can't stand to sleep in a hot room but have never had much success finding a pad that actually heated! This one does! It's fantastic and would be the world's greatest pad but for the horrendous control which is a nightmare! 2. There are two electrical cords that are easily placed on the sides under the mattress instead of having to lift the mattress to run a single cord. CONS: The nightmare control from hell - hence the 3 stars - 5 for the pad, 0 for the control. What numbnut said Yes - let's make a control that doesn't stay lit so when the customer wants to adjust the temperature of the pad at 3:00 a.m. they have to find the flashlight so they can see the controls! How stupid! Stupid! Stupid!<br />Please fire that twat and re-design the control to stay lit and send me that control please.

I got some 1oz lead tape strips recently and was able to confirm the weights on this scale. Using a smaller unit of measure like grams let me see smaller variations in the weights.<br /><br />No complaints about this scale. Sometimes I wish the platform was a little bigger, but for my purposes, it gets the job done no problem.",1674253974736,0,false
3,"Nice idea, but cheap execution","So there is a lot to like about this: it's stainless steel, has a nice aesthetic, and (my favorite!) comes with a little multi-purpose funnel that you can use to put powders/supplements in.<br /><br />In terms of the bottle itself, my biggest gripes are (a) that the top doesn't close very easily. You have to push from the back of the circle part to get it to close. Or apply a little pressure upward under the front lip and then press down. If you pop the top and try to close it absentmindedly with 1 hand, it won't close. And (b) the cap doesn't screw on very smoothly. Not like my Blender Bottles, which are smooth. I haven't had any leaks, but not having a smooth screw-on makes me feel like it may not be screwed on properly (but it usually is).<br /><br />The aesthetic of the bottle is great. It's a clean white color and the logo sticks off a little, which is a nice touch (i.e., it's not just a cheap screen printing application). The blender ball that comes with this is a little wider and flatter than the Blender Bottle ball, but it seems to work as well.<br /><br />My favorite part, and the only piece that will be put into my regular use rotation is the funnel. Being able to take some pre-workout, or a scoop or protein/supplements to mix later is really useful. And much cleaner than putting a scoop of something in a ziplock bag (which has backfired on me before. RIP)<br /><br />Overall, for $26, I like the stainless steel Blender Bottle more, which I also have. This one isn't bad by any means, but for the same price ($1 less, actually), you can get a higher quality bottle.",1674083538402,0,false
5,High quality frother! Great for mixing too,"[[VIDEOID:ebcf42dc419ba32799865ebcee4c6205]] This was the first time I had actually ever used a frother, and now I'm wondering how I went this long without one. I have been using this to mix my pre-workout (instead of having to shake it with one of those mixing balls), and it works great. Totally mixed in like 6 seconds (see video).<br /><br />It also comes with a nice little stand, which looks great on the counter and keeps the mixing end from touching anything. It uses AA batteries, which are not included unfortunately. Not sure how long they are supposed to last, but I'd imagine a while. Overall, we like it a lot!",1674081915240,0,false
4,"Decent heater, but doesn't get as warm as I'd like","This heater is OK. It's easy to use, works well, and has held up well over the past month or so that I've been using it. My biggest gripe with this is that it doesn't get THAT hot. The heat coming out is certainly warm, but it's not HOT, like I would expect (or like other space heaters I've had). On the highest setting, it will warm up a small area, but if your hands/feet in front of this, there is something the be desired.<br /><br />Another thing I don't love is that the vent is only at the top half of the heater. I would have preferred it to be at the bottom so it could better warm my feet, but that's obviously not a huge deal.<br /><br />Aside from the dealbreakers, it's not a bad unit. It's a good size, easy to operate, has a little space on the back to make it easy to pick up, and has a power cord that is adequately long. One thing that I like about this is that there is a lock so that the settings don't get changed while the unit is on.<br /><br />Overall, if this put out more heat, it would be 5 stars. But the high price + lower-than-desired heat knock it down to 4 stars.",1673585004115,1,false

3,Colorful but thin paper party streamers; difficult to start the roll,"There are seven very colorful crepe paper streamers in this package. They are thin but still functional. Also, they are not as wrinkly as other party streamers I've used previously. Starting the roll is difficult and about seven inches of each roll is wasted as a result. Nevertheless, these still work even though they are not great. At the current price of $7.99, this comes to $1.14 per roll.",1678564682004,1,false
2,Produces mild heat on highest setting; arrived with black smudges on top; initial use has heat smell,"This deep pocket heated mattress pad for a king-sized bed is like a heating pad. There are two controls that plug in on the top of the mattress cover and have settings for warm, low, medium, and high heat. The warm setting is the default. I could not feel much heat from any of the settings except for the high setting. The high setting provided a very low and very nice warmth. There are two controls; one for each side of the bed. There is a slight heat smell during first use.<br /><br />I have a king sized bed that has a tall mattress with a topper. I require 16"" deep pockets and the pockets on this are large enough to handle that even though there is nothing on the packaging that says that. This cover works (longevity unknown) but the CONS make this a pass for me.<br /><br />PROS<br />- It provides a nice light heat on the highest setting that apparently shuts off after 10 hours. I did not test the 10-hour shutoff as I'm rarely in bed for more than 6 hours.<br /><br />- There are two controls for both sides of the bed so the other bed partner can select a different heat setting.<br /><br />- The mattress pad is attractive and comfortable to lay on (except for the area with the plugs).<br /><br />- It has deep pockets for a tall king-size mattress and fits up to my mattress pocket size of 16"".<br /><br />CONS<br />- The electrical connection should have been located on the headboard side of the pad and only on the rim (meaning pocket side) of the pad. Currently, the connection is located at the foot of the mattress pad (based on the label). Of course, I can turn the label upside down and face the connection toward the top (which is what I did to access an electric socket); however, the plug on both sides is on the top and can be felt as a lump if laying down in that area.<br /><br />- The pad I received arrived with black smudges as if someone walked on the mattress pad. When I order a new product, I expect to receive it in pristine condition.<br /><br />- There was some cotton sticking out of the trim (see photo).  This is a minor detail and can just be cut off, but it is another sign of sloppiness.<br /><br />- Although the elastic section (pockets) fit over my mattress, the elastic is not gripping enough. This means, it is easy for the mattress pad to slide off the mattress unless I sandwich the remaining cloth between the mattress and the box spring.<br /><br />- There is a bit of a heat smell during first use; not much but is to be expected.<br /><br />- This unit has to be unplugged daily as there is no shutoff except for the claim that it shuts off after 10 hours, which I did not test.<br /><br />- I would not count on being able to wash this successfully. It says I can wash this in a machine for 5 min but I personally wouldn't do that. I would suggest spot cleaning if needed.<br /><br />In summary, this mattress pad works to produce very low heat on the highest setting. It will fit a king-sized bed with 16"" to perhaps 17"" deep pockets but the elastic is too loose to keep it on the bed unless it is wedged between the mattress and box spring. The location of the plugs is a problem and the dirty topper I received is an utter disappointment. The current price of $33.99 ($39.99 minus 15%) is very reasonable for this. A mattress pad without any heat for a king-sized bed is usually priced much higher. My recommendation is to pass on this pad and buy flannel sheets for the winter that keep one warm and toasty under the blankets. If a heated mattress pad is desired, I would say to look elsewhere.",1677329726281,1,false
4,Lovely gift set for mom for the current price of $21.99,"At the current price of $21.99, this gift box is a steal and the items inside are nice too.<br /><br />There are 10 items in this box. The items are:<br /><br />- one 10-ounce (not 13-ounce) heavy pink mug that says ""Best Mom Ever""<br />- four small bath bombs (sea salt, sage, lavender, and rose)<br />- one pair of pink chenille socks- one ""Remember I Love You Mom"" keyring<br />- one pink sleep mask- one pink hair turban for drying one's hair<br />- one tiny blank inside ""I Love You"" card with ""Best Wishes"" sticker<br /><br />I love the fragrance of the bath bombs but do not know how well they perform, since I have not tried them yet. However, the mug is very, very nice. It is heavy and feels great to hold. It is also large enough for a cup of tea. I would guess, however, that it is NOT microwaveable due to the gold-like trim along the top rim.<br /><br />The pink sleep mask is okay but not great because the band in the back stretches but the fabric lets light seep through since it is pink. The elastic is not tight, so someone with a super small head might find this mask loose. It fit me perfectly, however.<br /><br />The hair turban is another favorite item of mine. In fact, this along with the mug make this gift box worth it at the current price. I know the Amazon site says the mug holds 13 ounces but it only held 10 ounces of water to the tippy top when I measured it. The socks are soft but not the highest quality. Nevertheless, most mom's who receive this gift box would appreciate the items inside and the price does not ""break the bank.""",1676773734651,0,false
4,"Nice, soft, furry throw that is a bit overpriced for what it is","This is a nice throw that arrives in a shrink-wrapped package (see photo) but expands as shown (see photos). It is fuzzy on one side and silky on the other. The backing is not sewn to the throw except at the edges. This means it does not always fold well and stay aligned with the front during use. That is typical of any throw made this way and is typical of others I own.<br /><br />The throw has a very soft feel but I did expect the furry part to be more plush with a longer pile, especially since the price was listed at $35.99 when I purchased it and is now $29.99. The current price is about $10 more than I would expect to spend and certainly more than I've spent in the past for similar throws with shorter fibers. Nevertheless, this is really nice and my cats definitely approve. I'm certainly not disappointed with my purchase, especially since a 50% discount was applied at checkout when it was listed at the higher price.<br /><br />I would not consider this giftable unless it is removed from the shrink-wrapped plastic wrapping.",1676503348454,2,false

5,Make sure of the axle size before you order,"Great tire, has grease zerks too and hub covers. 3/4 inch axle and 400 lb rating. Not for a garden tractor with a loader. Says it fits John Deere 300 series, that's utter nonsense. These are for lawn tractors not garden tractors.  I did return them no problem",1677232329273,6,true
5,Awesome size,"I like that I can have a bowl of soup without filling it to the brim and still walk from my stove top to the table. Great for pasta dishes and especially salads. They make good serving bowls for veggies. Ok, they are to small for popcorn. Great for Oriental cooking with rice and Chowmein or orange chicken you name it.

5,One hell of a great kitchen scissors/shears,What I don't  like is family members taking my scissors and not putting them back because these scissors will cut through most smaller bones and cardboard and heavy duty plastics. Seriously thee best kitchen scissors I have ever owned. Aside from the fact I really use them for cutting into plastic bags and shrink wrapped meat but they really shine cutting up slabs of meat for stew or soup. I can rip up a whole chicken into 8 pieces pretty fast. So I'm sitting here wondering who took my sissors again and thought about buying a second one... We'll see,1672724107942,0,false

5,Absolutely perfect- multi uses are such a great surprise! Best gift ever-,"100% smitten with this charcuterie board!! Something introduced to me by my daughter- as I’ve only known meat + cheese platter/board from back in the day! Ha..see you can teach those from the “old school” new wisdom! This is a perfect addition for any kitchen- as it serves a multitude of purpose for any user.. ideal for a spoiler, independent living in one’s first apartment.. a perfect wedding gift to bring years of use and so on.. Truly, there’s no scenario this would not be a great addition with its endless options! Sized perfectly to expand for bigger gatherings and priced even better to purchase a gift that will be around for years to come..<br /><br />What is absolutely amazing with this set- is the flexibility and versatility to meet your every need. This set can expand from just a standard charcuterie serving unit and transform into so much more! This has capacity to become a veggie tray, olive platter, meats and cheese tray, bread loaf server including jams/jellies, cream cheese, yogurt, dipping sauces, fruit/berry combo, crackers.. anything of the sort. The Tetris style x4 piece unit can be used in any capacity.. or, serve multipurpose style at one time. If all of this isn’t needed- ha! It can also be kept solid and serve your need in the standard charcuterie setting.<br /><br />Loving the built in gutters they are perfect for keeping any water, wet or juices from an item placed in its triangular space from running off the board- it a perfect canal system if used in this capacity. The long smaller board is ideal for a mini loaf of sourdough, bruschetta or any other type bread or cracker spread.. and included dishes allow for your sauces and such- small cutlery is included for specified items but feel free to use anything else to accompany! For instance, this includes space for sauce/dip but comes without a spoon.. I find a bag of mini sized tasting spoons to be ideal! but utilize whatever you’d like..<br /><br />To give you an idea- we used flavored yogurts with varied grapes last week.. and board was a perfect set up! Tbh, i’ve gone to using this set more than any other item since it’s been yr. end football parties, the all star basketball game and even my husbands birthday brouhaha!! This charcuterie has steps up in spades! One I would not hesitate to recommend- Hoping info can help your decision.. stay safe everyone and bon appétit!!",1678558859675,0,false
4,Nice quality product and aesthetics- its universal for any recipient.,"A happy medium in 7oz. amber jar with lid- has ample/easy light wick.. Soy burns clean and offers 35-40 hr. of realistic time. 98% of candle was spent before wick burned to the quick. At $18 it’s a higher price  option for a gift of this size.<br /><br />Scent is pleasant, nothing synthetic g’ma or overbearing. Noticeable lavender fragrance when opened but seems to lack a stronger throw. Reach is approx. 1-3ft. so, it’s best set on desktop, nightstand, bathtub edge, bathroom, etc.. close enough for user to enjoy the aroma.<br /><br />Presents in a cubed box that can be wrapped or gifted as is. These have a printed label and lid that bring a sweet sentiment or even a touch of humor.. the label can help personalize for a specific or special occasion. I find this a very safe gift that recipient would enjoy- universal fit for anyone.. without been over personal. Hoping info helps decision.. stay safe everyone!<br /><br />*Note: our wick was somehow in the candle a bit crooked.. what started out completely dead center must have had a curve in the wick.. bc you can see in photos and have shifted? Guessing it got off center in the pour?",1678530457810,0,false
5,Made for true mid size wingback. Beautiful quality fabric- made it work but..,"As you can see.. it looks good from afar in the fit- but, far from good! Having said that- not sure what else to do.. I DID MEASURE!! Truth is, it is hard to know exactly what measurement to focus on.. we came in under one measurement and over in the other.. so, it was a tad difficult to know for certain- I had hoped they would compensate each other!? Having what is referred to as an ”Alice in Wonderland” style wingback chair.. It is an oversized wingback with a robust build and excess cushion everywhere to go with it. A chair passed on from my parents, that holds a lot of sentimental value. It’s the quirkiest, one of a kind style and one I want to preserve! Problem is, the upholstery had seen much better days.. and would be beyond quite pricy to redo at this moment!!<br /><br />The cover is made of the softest velvet with a sturdy and durable feel- it is a spot on color in burgundy for us.. a perfect match! I measured to the best of my ability.. Keep in mind- if you have larger wings like I do.. and mine also has an imperial roll off the top of each wing, as well as being cushioned throughout. So, cover between wings doesn’t lay flush to the chair cushion… when sitting- fabric pushes back into place bc there is plenty of stretch however, if no weight is present- fabric is free floating about 2” off the actual chair itself between the wings! It is snug everyplace else. Very hard to capture in photos. You can also see bc of the larger wing the backside coverage doesn’t quite meet the bottom of chair by about 8-11”. So, cover only works bc our chair is placed into a corner and it hides the back side. I’ve shown the back in a photo to give you an idea of just how it almost fits everywhere but here!<br /><br />Having said where this falls short.. I must add it is the first time I’ve even gotten close to getting a fit. Trying x2 others covers had results that were comical! We’ve left this on the chair bc.. it will suffice + looks far better then the tattered upholstery underneath. I do suggest this is designed to fit the happy medium wingback.. not one tall/oversized like ours and not the minimalist style that calls itself a wingback but lacks what it takes to accentuate the actual wing portion of the chair. As for measurements- I can’t help specify the fit issue.. our chair was 4” over in height but, 4.75” under in width and wings were the right size but obviously far more robust. So, it seemed this may do the job.. and it almost does!<br /><br />Quality for $35- is great.. getting a correct fit may be a bit tricky.. it may take some trial and error. Hoping info helps decision- stay safe everyone.",1678529447822,0,false
3,Tippy-Toe lift- that’s it!! Rock solid build.. bit only offers about 3.5” of extra!,"Everything about this is beautiful… rocksolid in material and stability. Build is beyond easy- so simple to just attach preset screws in legs to the bottom.. that is it!!! NO tools needed..<br /><br />So excited to use as the boost necessary to reach higher cabinets with being only 5’1” ..I was thrilled how well this matched kitchen attire and unlike any plastic or metal option I’ve used in the past. However, I was completely disheartened in the fact, it only offers up a few inches of height and for some like myself- this really doesn’t add much- or def. not enough.. step didn't even provide me access to the next shelf up!! It is officially just a TIPPY-TOE LIFT UP!!<br /><br />I realize I’m going against the majority with this one.. BUT, isn’t a step stool to give you a step higher!!? I wish this was labeled as such.. calling this an ”Adult step stool” I guess I did not realize that meant it was a short rise… I’ll take the blame for not realizing its specifications!! Solid piece of beautiful wood thick enough to provide the upmost confidence to stand on. Fat/wide metal legs provide security.. The fact this can slide under the bottom cabinet lip should give a realistic idea of what it actually provides in way of height.. Not very much!<br /><br />For $32- it’s a perfect look one wants to achieve.. just without an ability to step up! One I wish was better identified at its offering of its 3.5” rise up!! Could make a nice time out, still or thinking chair for a little one to take a breather or cool down on! But won’t offer much besides those 3.5” hoping info helps decision- stay safe everyone!",1678507426279,0,false
4,Unique look and fun alternative to the standard- pros/cons below..!!,"Unique! Love the deep toxic red.. instantly eye catching. Wish the logo was deciphered or at least translated to a wine connotation- but, pretty certain it’s just a brand logo which is unfortunate being so prominent!<br /><br />The larger bowl offers ample room for fill and every amount in between. Stainless material feels similar to that of the stemless wine tumbler cups that are all the latest trend- of course exception is this one has a stem!<br /><br />Already used x3 since arrival without a hint of a metallic aftertaste! Washing by hand with a hot soapy water/sponge caused zero issue with any interior staining or exterior scratching.<br /><br />Non-breakable feature is ideal on the go: in RV, houseboat, romantic wknd. getaway, picnic basket, etc. stainless takes away worry of shattered glass- note: a slightly thinner stem could bend/break under wrong angle or pressure.. so, stem is not indestructible! I’d prefer the bottom was solid without a raised inward lip and hollow underside- basically like a bell. But so far the cup seems stable.<br /><br />A set of wine goblets with a unique and one of a kind vibe. Could make a great gift if “logo?!” doesn’t throw anyone off. Fun and memorable way to commemorate a special event- I really fun look on display or used for decor as well! Hoping info helps decision.. stay safe everyone.",1677430097654,0,false
5,Artwork in a bowl- unique and beautiful use of mango wood- impressed!,"I am absolutely smitten with this wooden bowl!! Our need was very quirky and very specific purpose- tasked to replace a smaller and non-functional little bowl that is main piece in a Montessori activity used daily at a children’s therapy clinic! This new option stepped up in spades being larger in size and non-plastic or glass breakable design! Bowl fit our need even better than anticipated. I realize this isn’t the intended purpose and tbh, it was so hard NOT to utilize for my own kitchen or decorative measures- bc, I LOVE THIS INCREDIBLE LOOK AND VIBE..!!!<br /><br />As seen in my included photos, there are what some may consider a few flaws and yet, it’s what I find most endearing.. the character! A non-fabricated look shows off its authenticity and being recently introduced to mango wood- I’m a fan. I’ve not seen it used in this capacity.. it’s very unique! The wood has a beautiful grain and the chosen finish still allows it to shine thru.<br /><br />Made by a well known quality brand- Fitz + Floyd, one can trust info.  provided and printed on bottom of bowl. It states you can serve hot or foods from this dish and therefore, I would trust its no issue doing so. It could also be used as fruit bowl or, a beautiful decor item as well. Even though our use is not doing it justice but is a necessary one! At $29, I absolutely would chose again. Is a functional piece of artwork and if cared for it can be enjoyed for quite some time! Hoping info helps decision.. stay safe everyone.",1677386116528,0,false
3,Single 36” wide size (NOT 80” queen size!) lower profile- NO built in pump!!,"Listed as a queen this is actually just 36” across when the standard width is 80”.. So, not even close! Being far smaller its more in line with a twin. Be aware if needing for x2 peep-it may prove problematic!<br /><br />Also note- the lower profile! Perks: it will take far less time to fill up and it will also fit into tighter spaces ie, back of camper or truck bed, inside of tent, etc.. if used for kiddos they aren’t rolling off to injury!l  Quirks: may be difficult for older/compromised person to get up/down from just above floor level- something to keep in mind.<br /><br />Online Ad itself states pump needed to fill along with instructions.. but, the box may be a bit confusing!? Not only does it list queen size, it also claims to have built in pump! FYI- NO PUMP IS BUILT IN..!! You need a pump to fill mattress.<br /><br />Fill process approx. 5min. and prior to any weight in acclimated temp. mattress held air without leaking. *Dependent on temp. variances one should expect mat to expand/contract- ie, filled outdoors at nite while camping in Mtn’s mats tighter exterior will hold less air. The same mat moved into warm sun will relax and stretch in heat.. appearing to have lost air- when really outer material stretches creating more space.. and that extra space is what empty!! Whew- Science lesson at its finest! Body weight also causes mat to stretch.. keep in mind mat may need daily “top of dose” of air to maintain comfort/shape! (If using on the go- take pump along just in case!)<br /><br />Felt top is soft and helps eliminate sweating in plastic materials and helps keep blankets slipping off! Last fyi- doesn’t seem to have the stated “built-in” pillow in the design.. tbh, not a dealbreaker for us as a real pillow is always a must. Have to be sure you’re aware.<br /><br />Ideal for juvenile/teen sleep overs.. camping for x1 adult or x2 kiddos. Best for smaller needs vs. extended use. Hoping info helps clear up any unsure aspects- stay safe everyone!",1676941157625,1,false
5,More personal homemade option.. to spoil a loved one!!,"A happy medium in 9oz. amber jar with lid- has ample/easy light wick.. Soy burns clean and offers 35-40 hr. of realistic time. 98% of candle was spent before wick burned to the quick. At $15 it’s a solid option for a gift.<br /><br />The homemade touch elevates it to a more personal level… colored printed label resembles a fun love note which also helps personalize for for a specific someone or occasion.<br /><br />Scent is pleasant, nothing synthetic g’ma or overbearing. Noticeable rose fragrance when opened but seems to lack a stronger throw. Reach is approx. 1-3ft. so, best set desktop, nightstand, bathroom, bathtub edge, etc.. place close enough for user to enjoy the aroma.<br /><br />Presents in a cubed box that can be wrapped or gift as is- hoping info helps decision.. stay safe everyone.",1676767236080,0,false
3,Distance not strength- gift that offers generic safety without a WoW!,"Solid size with a capacity to burn multiple days.. has a simple or generic feel which there are actually situations those type gifts are necessary! Nothing overly personal or intimate with product if intending to use as a gift. Depending on exterior quote candle is universal in regards to older/younger, family/friend/coworker, thank you/holiday etc.. one gets 17oz. of mileage for a lower price!<br /><br />Nothing about scent is off putting or obnoxious.. bc, is all but noticed while burning.. I’d like to say otherwise but it just doesn’t have any real throw. I notice melting wax aroma when lit.. more than anything else. On the flip side.. this doesn’t stink nasty like some grocery or discount store wannabes can when sampled so, this is a perk! Opening package is when fragrance is at its best- so, recipient will be please at prospect.. it just won’t get any stronger than that.<br /><br />May be option for some that can serve a safe, generic purpose- One I would choose a differently next time. I’d rather less candle with a better fragrance ability. Hoping info helps decision- stay safe everyone.",1676427151643,0,false
5,Perfect surprise for kids in college dorm..!!,With mine away in college.. and not home this year for Easter. I wanted to help bring a little Easterto  where she’s at! Perfect for a room with small space as these take up nothing!! Hung on dorm window you get a lot of mileage for just minimal effort.. Absolutely perfect to be seen across the quad at night!<br /><br />These arrive ready to go x3 triple A ea.!! Battery compartment is built into suction cup.. simply hang and BooM! Flip tiny button on side lets to activate at will! Only improvement wish would be- if these had timer option to shut off or if they were light sensitive to turn on/off as it got dark/light outside. Not a dealbreaker- just saves bulbs if out or unable to be home to shut off.. Ha! I’m sure she’s always at library studying and that’s why they can stay for an all night.. and it has nothing to do with the frat parties.. right?!!<br /><br />Cute simple shapes are clearly distinguished and nothing offensive to any religious beliefs- fun for springtime decor just the same.. unique as I’ve never seen something like it before- it was a total hit and social ice breaker.. Mine said she gets knocks on her dorm door asking where can they get a set too! Who knew.. Hoping info helps decision- stay safe everyone.,1675420635633,0,false
5,4.5 star.. Great quality and craftsmanship just oversized!,"Trying to match an impossible burnt brick color- Cosmic rust was finally a match!! Tbh, I find solid quality and really liked the wider cable knit- it reminds me of an old cozy sweater! Yarn feels soft enough (No! It’s not angora soft.. but, not scratchy linen either!!) Using acrylic will wear better especially if on the family couch to see a lot of action! I find it will also help avoid easy snags or knit becoming too loose.. The pattern created with the knitting also adds a nice artistic touch! No loose snags or unfinished stitching, zipper opened smooth without glitching on edges when closing.. I find this has a solid quality control.<br /><br />The only part that lacked perfection was its ample sizing.. the reason I mention is when filled with pillow insert. The edges and corners are a bit floppy and understated! TBH, I prefer a robust, fluffed and overstuff look and to accomplish this- One needs to use extra batting or upsize the insert (ie. if purchased an 18x18.. then a 20x20 insert may fill the excess void!) not a dealbreaker. Just wanting you to be aware.. hence why I would remove .5 star if I could.<br /><br />Otherwise, great quality, and a very soft, comfortable and pretty find! Hoping info helps decision- stay safe everyone!",1674346969451,0,false
4,A solid mid size- great for making stews in the oven! (more of a 4.5 star!),"This makes a great stew pot for inside the oven.. Im really liking overall size for my family who’s currently winnowed down to only x3 of us at home (not all x6 as usual!) This is be an ideal option for newlyweds just starting their pot/pan collection! One they can grow into or even host extras no prob! I find it has room for an ample amount.. without being obnoxiously oversized. Depending on what’s on the menu- I see this best for a solid x4-5 adult servings for sure.<br /><br />Pot fits inside oven with room to spare.. plenty of clearance for the lid handle too (not even on lowest rack either!) The robust base can also encompass the stove top burner perfectly- if you don’t judge my dirty oven.. view photos included of interior/exterior oven and stove top pic.!<br /><br />Bottom has tiered level designed to acclimate the heat more evenly.. all for producing better results with your meal! (photo upclose of base as well.) The cherry on top is no interior rivets from any of the handles!! Both lid + inside of pot is 100% smooth! No cracks or crevices for food to get stuck, baked into and become a cleaning nightmare! *Handles are solid metal.. they WILL get HOT!! Never open without protection. Pots with plastic covering- can crack/break over time in heat.<br /><br />*Take note: vinyl sticker on front should be removed.. and it does so by simple peeling. Do this prior to heating so to be certain this does not melt and adhere to the pot! Otherwise, it can melt and create a burnt plastic smell!!<br /><br />A solid choice for a variety of options! Makes a great addition or spoiler for any kitchen needing a mid size pot.. it doesn’t have nonstick coating so, pretreating can help with cleanup. Good to know it’s dishwasher safe! Happy with choice for sure- Hoping info helps decision.. stay safe everyone- and bon appétit!!",1674014332846,2,false
4,Clever homemade candle with a surprise message in the wax..!!,"A unique candle with a whimsical vibe and cleverly “hidden” message found in the wax itself by the use of tiny lettered beads.. The mid size 7oz. jar provided approx. 35-40 hr. of burn time and 98% of the candle was spent before wick ran completely out! No issue with any ash or heavy soot using soy wax/natural oils.<br /><br />These have a printed label with an added “tongue ń cheek” humor.. that help personalize for a specific or special occasion. Lettered beads in the wax becomes loose and fall to the bottom without issue-<br /><br />Scent is pleasant with nothing synthetic or overbearing.. I find it pleasant but lacking a strong enough throw. Reach is approx. 1-3ft. so, I suggest using on a desktop, nightstand, bathroom, bathtub edge.. any place close enough for user to enjoy the aroma. Lavender is detected with a lingering eucalyptus fragrance-<br /><br />Gift ready in a fun cube box- this brings a more personal touch to just a standard candle. Hoping info helps decision.. stay safe everyone!",1673885109882,0,false
4,$40 of power.. this has power in its 1200w motor!!,"Wow.. for a blender that doesnt break the bank- this offers up a smooth ability by a 6-blade base and its 1200w of power!! This system creates a vortex that pulls towards the blades which is helpful and necessary to actually “crush, pulverize, blend, smooth” its content. With x2 simple speeds (plus, a power push button!) you basically get a combo of above as your results. I find its the length of time blending that changes or affects the consistency. Longer blend = smoother outcome.<br /><br />Purchasing specifically for smoothies- I was after a creamy smooth outcome..and so far even tougher items (ice, whole frozen strawberries) went through exceptionally well. I find this blends best using either- a soft amount of liquid like yogurt or a juice mixed with fruits/ice to help the blending process. *In order to keep blades sharp- DO NOT put blade base in dishwasher as it prematurely dulls sharpness! Hack: to wash by hand: rinse out ALL content. Next- add just x1 drop of soap and fill 1/4 with warm h20.. turn on low and blend! This will soap up insides very thoroughly- Then, rinse completely.. and BooM, all clean!!<br /><br />Made with a glass body this is sturdy and solid- won’t tip easily.. easy to pour spout helps transfer into smaller cups. Tbh, I most likely won’t blend in smaller cup bc I like the extra room as, I find it produces better results. A great gift option or spoiler for self.. a solid for dorm with a kitchenette, 1st apartment, wedding gift etc.. Silver base is a sleek look to leave on counter top and look sharp! It has small footprint and needs minimal space.. height fits under my overhead cabinets perfectly with a few inches to spare- it looks great. Hoping info helps decision- stay safe everyone..",1673602617070,1,false
4,Very unique wax idea.. brings an added flare of fun!,"Handmade candle to commemorate the joys of marriage! Aesthetics are made with personal touches and whimsical personality- with the added heart wax inserts and glitter atop of the candle wax itself.. To the fun “tongue + cheek” label with small sketched skull!!I I think front label could refrain from candle “details..” as those would be better included on the back (out of sight) so candle just looked pretty vs. advertisement when set out. But only a suggestion as this is a step above gift for any looking for a candle..<br /><br />Nothing offputting about the scent.. I chose jasmine, sea salt, wood + cream.. nothing yuck, synthetic or overbearing- it reminds me of a soft floral lotion or spa fragrance.. I only wish it delivered a stronger throw- it’s the only part that felt could improve. I find it’s best used in an approx. 1-3ft. radius from the user so aroma can be enjoyed. Nice on a desk top, night stand, tub side or bathroom- anyplace close enough to notice. No worries about ”extras” in the wax! Additions to the wax just melt and absorb into the candle itself once burning takes place.<br /><br />Comes in a cubed box- with ability to gift wrap easy enough. I appreciate fact it states “handmade” on the top flap as well.. when specifically purchasing for this feature, it’s nice to let recipient know as well! Hoping info helps decision- stay safe everyone.",1673563611578,0,false
5,Super sturdy.. perfect in living room- Love its creature comforts!!,"For under $100.. I’m loving how solid and sturdy this is when built and  next to a living room chair or couch- one can have confidence it won’t wobble or tip.. Ideal to set a lamp on or feel worry free if coffee/drink is atop. It’s built to be used..!!!<br /><br />Instructions are straightforward- and electronic component is already to go- you basically construct around it.. huge perk as, I was unsure what that would entail! I built with a buddy to have extra hands help steady.. we used electric screwdriver and completed in less than 20min. Tbh, a buddy isn’t necessary.. but, it does make for fun conversation!<br /><br />All seams come together really well and as mentioned- legs on floor (even carpet..) are solid. This does not feel cheap or flimsy. No- do not expect a heirloom collector piece.. but I think that goes without saying!<br /><br />Perfect item for that spot you need device charge, storage..accessibility. It’s ideal for an apartment, empty space in living room or even used as a nightstand. This is versatile- as it holds a few needed items discreetly in the flip top lid and can act as bookshelf or plant holder underneath! Could even be placed in entryway as a catch all- this smaller size gives you versatility. Easy to clean with polish- wood doesn’t appear like a particleboard in anyway.. it has nice wood grain appearance.<br /><br />A great option for that one little space or place you need a small table, stand, charge station, catch all.. this is a solid find! Hoping info helps decision.. stay safe everyone!",1673513451628,0,false
4,"Great for dorm, apartment or even an add-on vacuum at home..!!","This has the right idea.. it’s great for those that may have smaller space to vacuum and don’t want a lot of fuss..its true some just want a simple vacuum! Not overdone in accessories/features- it has x4 floor options. Cordless with ability to hold solid charge over 30min. (unless it’s spring cleaning day.. I don’t need longer than that!) I appreciate its smaller size which is especially ideal for a dorm, small apartment, any place without a lot of storage- this has a smaller footprint.<br /><br />I love power boost button.. but, why not build with that level of suction always- bc of course it’s more effective!!? Boost is especially helpful on hardwood/tile floors to catch those menacing crumbs that like to hide.<br /><br />Easy to empty and even wipe clean.. I LOVE the year worth of filters it comes with as, it is so hard to track them down after purchase!! *If you trade filter every few months it helps keep all the dust particles from blowing about and lets them be consumed.. OHH, I LOVE THIS!!<br /><br />Simple on/off switch and swapping of components. For a smaller size this is still substantial.. not too heavy but, bc it doesn’t offer the most ideal hold or comfort grip- it can feel awkward. This was biggest dislike for me overall. Not a dealbreaker.. bc it’s still manageable to handle and maneuver for the 30-45 min. while the battery holds its charge.<br /><br />Not a lifetime vacuum but one that will go some distance and keep your space clean with its abilities.. bonus filters and all!!

3,"It is pretty cool, but the color coordinates are not good",When I first opened it and looked at it it took me about 30 seconds to see what I was looking at the only reason behind that is is because the black hat has not one stitch of color on the brim of it which makes it run into his face and hard to figure out who he is at first once you realize who he is then you can see it all at once. But I showed a few people in my family and nobody could figure out quite where his face was located and the features were all because of the fact that the black was just too much on the hat and it ran into his face and did not make it so profound. Other than that the blanket is awesome it is soft I have not had a chance to wash it yet because I'm afraid the colors will run so I think after the first use I will just hang it on my wall. But all in all it's not bad but I think the choice of coloring was not good at all.,1673137574861,0,false

2,"Great, until it fell apart!","I am in a nursing home, and I had it sitting on a table at the end of my bed. I reached for it with my grabber tool, to pull it towards me, and the side literally just popped off. There are two miniscule nails holding it together, which are as thick as office staples. As soon as that side came off, the rest of it started to come apart as well. I started to do a return, but it said it had to be returned in original packaging, which of course I didn't keep. Or I could get an exchange, but I what if that falls apart too? I noticed that beside the tiny, insignificant nails, there is a trail of wood glue that is about the width of a human hair. I think if they had used bigger nails or more wood glue, it would have stayed together. I'm just going to try and hot glue it back together. If that doesn't work, I have elbow joint brackets I can screw on to each corner. If not for it falling apart, I would have given it 5 stars.

5,Good Trash Can for Cramped Spaces,"We needed a small trash can for a bathroom that has cramped space, and we looked to this one to fill that need. It's a good fit for what we need, though because of its size it is not suitable for situations where there's a lot of trash to be collected.<br /><br />This is a very small can that can fit between cabinets and fixtures or even under a sink. It has a low profile too so it doesn't have much of a space requirement above when it is opened.<br /><br />The open mechanism is the typical foot pedal that pops the lid up. It has a soft close when the pedal is released. I like that - the lid doesn't just slam down and make a noise when the can closes. I also like that the liner is easy to remove and clean.<br /><br />The one concern with this can - and it should be fairly obvious - is that it's very small and is not suitable for someplace like a kitchen or an office where a lot of things get thrown away. With a small capacity, this can is best suited in low traffic areas. For us, we wanted this can for a small bathroom and it's very well placed there.<br /><br />This is a nice little trashcan - with emphasis on the word ""little"". It's a good fit for half-baths and other low-traffic areas where there isn't a lot of trash to throw away.",1678787112625,0,false
4,"Easy to Set, Sound is Pleasant; Small Digits Display","One of the things we use a lot in our house is kitchen timers. We have a small collection of them for different purposes. My favorite one was similar in design to this, but I simply wore it out. I was hopeful that this one would be a suitable replacement. While it’s a good timer, there are a couple of areas where I think it could be improved.<br /><br />Operation is very simple. The outer ring of the timer spins to either the left to right to increase the time in 1-minute intervals. This is a straightforward design and makes setting the time easy without struggling with small or hard-to-press buttons. It goes all the way up to 90 minutes and counts down by seconds to zero. That’s all well and good, but for my purposes having a smaller interval – even as coarse as 15 seconds – is better. I can use this timer for most of my cooking needs, but it isn’t suitable for other things I time where the interval needs a fraction of a minute. For the large majority of cases, a one-minute interval should be fine.<br /><br />Many timers have a memory of the last setting used, but this one does not. If you need to time something more than once, you have to set it manually every time.<br /><br />The main complaint I have with this timer is the display. The numbers are small. They’re small enough that unless the timer is very close it is difficult to read. There’s room on the face for bigger digits so I am not sure why the timer was designed with such small digits.<br /><br />It works well and I especially like the sound it makes when it goes off. The alarm is a lower pitch than most of the other times with which I have worked and the volume is about right too, which makes this timer easier on the ears for me. I can overlook some of the other design issues (of which most are really are minor things) just because of the sound.<br /><br />This is a nice little timer but it could have been better. It’s easy to set and I especially like the sound it makes when it finishes counting down. It does have a couple of areas that could be improved, though (in particular the size of the digits on the display), which keep it from being an outstanding product.",1678560835560,0,false
4,Decent Office Chair,"I needed a good chair with lumbar support for myself and selected this one, knowing little about the brand. I have not had it long but I am mostly pleased with it, though I see one potential area for improvement.<br /><br />Like any office chair, this one comes disassembled and you need to put it together. Everything needed is in the box, including the tool to put all of the fasteners in place. Unlike most furniture that requires assembly, the hardware is individually packed corresponding to steps that are outlined in the assembly instructions, so there is less chance of mistakes during assembly.<br /><br />I had the chair completely assembled in about 20 minutes, and the only reason it took me that long is that I made a minor assembly error with the headrest and needed to undo that mistake and reassemble. This was because I misread the instructions, not because the instructions were bad or unclear.<br /><br />Since the chair came on a night when all of us were together as a family, we took turns trying it out and messing with the settings and getting comfortable in it. It’s fairly straightforward to adjust and doesn’t require a user manual or a lot of hand strength to make adjustments. The base is comfortable and the lumbar support is simple and non-adjustable, but it is exactly what I needed. The arm rests can be adjusted for people who need a wider or more narrow seat, using the included tool to loosen and then adjust the rests as necessary (so keep the tool around if more than one person needs the chair).<br /><br />I was surprised by the foot rest, which was an unexpected feature. When the chair is reclined back and the foot rest is extended, it is comfortable enough to take a brief nap. I have to be careful with this feature...<br /><br />For all of the positives, we found one negative. It is a heavy chair and it is quite comfortable, but we all agreed that this is probably not a heavy-duty chair that will last. I go through chairs at a rate of about one every two years; I have a strong suspicion that this one will not quite go that far, though I am hopeful that I’ll be pleasantly surprised.<br /><br />This is a decent office chair that has a lot of nice features. It seems to be made reasonably well and it is easy to assemble, though there’s some question about how well it will hold up under daily use.",1677927434775,0,false
5,Better than Expected,"My experiences with Farberware have been mostly positive, though I view a lot of their products as lower-end kitchen wares. I selected this small paddle board more as a serving plate than a cutting board. I have been pleasantly surprised with it as it is of higher quality than I expected.<br /><br />This is a small, round paddle board with a juice groove. It's not big enough to use as a carving board for a chicken or anything like that but is well suited for working with blocks of cheese, fruits and vegetables. If you need a larger board for chopping and cutting, this is the wrong choice.<br /><br />My particular board is made from three pieces of wood and it is clear where the seams are. The seams are actually very smooth and I cannot feel any ridge along the glue line at all, on either the top or the bottom of the board. When I glide my hand across the surface, I cannot tell by feel where one piece ends and the next begins.<br /><br />This is not to say it's perfect, though. I did find one small rough spot on the side of the board, near the handle. If this board was expensive I would be much more concerned about that, but the spot is small and the price is low enough to more than compensate for a small blemish like this.<br /><br />The weight is decent too. It's not awkward to pick up (meaning, it isn't weirdly balanced), so unless it is loaded with heavy things and carried by the handle it  should be balanced decently.<br /><br />It doubles as a hot pad for hot sauce pans, though I have other things that are better suited for that.<br /><br />I am pleased with this board.

3,"Decent Cutting Surface and Interesting Design, but Room for Improvement","I selected this cutting board set with the thought of using with with less countertop mess. It has not worked out quite like I envisioned. There are some design decisions that went into this product that merit a revisit.<br /><br />This is a bamboo-surface cutting board with enough room to handle some of the larger jobs you might have in the kitchen - trimming a steak, cutting up butternut squash, breaking down a pineapple, and so on. I have no complaints with the size or the cutting surface which is smooth and not easily gashed without a serrated knife. Under the cutting surface are two steel catch bins with is great for prep work.<br /><br />Where this product falls short is in two areas. First, it would have been useful to have a canal for draining off the juice trap. As received, the juice trap canal has no channel for drainage, so when it's full it just overflows. To drain it, it either needs to be inverted or the liquid needs to be mopped out. Second, this unit will not store compactly with the bamboo lids on the catch trays. Either the trays have to be removed for separate storage, or the tray lids stored upside down on top of the cutting board. Neither is ideal.<br /><br />This is not a bad cutting board system, but there is room for improvement. The design is interesting and the craftmanship is fine, but minor oversights tarnish this enough from being a great product.",1675681768176,0,false
5,Stable and Attractive,"I have tried under-the-cabinet paper towel mounts and have had trouble with them, from proper fit to bad mounting brackets. As a result, we have kept paper towels on the counter, just sitting next to the mixer, and this has been satisfactory most of the time, though the towel roll frequently gets knocked over or occasionally unravels, plus it can be appear cluttered. I selected this paper towel holder with the idea of keeping the paper towel roll out of the way and looking a little more organized. So far, I am very pleased with it.<br /><br />This looks like a cast iron holder but it is not. It is painted steel, and though it does have a little heft to it, it's lighter than cast iron. It is not a big thing, just right for a full roll of paper towels without taking up any extra room.<br /><br />The base is stable and we haven't had troubles knocking over the roll since we popped it on the holder. More importantly, though, the roll has not unraveled itself because of the arm that serves to keep the roll compact and it also provides support when tearing.<br /><br />My wife commented that she likes the top loop which makes moving the roll very simple and easy, more secure than handling the roll directly.<br /><br />So far we're both very pleased with this paper towel holder. After having trouble with under-cabinet mounting solutions we have a solution that works well for us. Based on our experience with it, this is easy to recommend if you want a countertop paper towel holder.",1674472909351,0,false
5,"Easy to Set, Keeps Good Time So Far","I selected this clock because I have an alarm clock that slowly drifts in time and is difficult to set. I wanted a clock that was easy to read without being blinding, but more importantly I wanted one that is easy to set. This one has answered both of those requirements so far. I use my phone as an alarm clock so I do not use this clock specifically for waking me up, but it does have some nice features in that area.<br /><br />This is a decent-sized clock, about the size of a grapefruit. It sits upright and is stable and I have had no trouble with it tipping or being wobbly on the shelf. It's farily conservative in design - white outer shell, black face, white LED lighting.<br /><br />The numbers are easy enough to read and there are several brightness levels. I find the brightest level is just too bright, and the dimmest is too dim for me, so I have chosen the middle ground. It is surprising to me that for an alarm clock white LEDs were chosen for the display instead of red. White is certainly easy to see both in the day and at night, but red is better for reading at night.<br /><br />The time and alarms are very easy to set, a big improvement over my old clock. Also, so far the time has not drifted noticeably, though I have not had this clock long enough to know how much it drifts over a period of time. It it is skewed by less than a minute after 6 months I will be satisfied. If I switch to this clock to actually wake me, I like that I can set two separate alarms and can set more than just a time where the clock lights off. That is, I like that I can set the alarm for weekdays only if I want, though there are still more ways to set it.<br /><br />So far I am happy with this clock. It does what I need, it looks nice and it is easy to set up. It has replaced my old alarm clock.",1672918247542,0,false
5,"Easy Set Up, Easy to Read, and Accurate","I selected this clock with the idea of keeping it in the basement where I needed a clock and didn't want to deal with changing the time between DST and Standard Time. This looked like a good atomic clock and I have had good experiences with Sharp as a brand, so my expectations were good. So far it has met my expectations.<br /><br />This is an atomic clock that auto-updates and tracks the outdoor temperature with a remote sensor. Set-up is easy - put in batteries, plug in and the unit gets to work. It can take some time to get an update but once it updates it tracks the time very well. If it doesn't update immediately, be patient because it will.<br /><br />The temperature remote is easy to understand and place. It's best to put it in a location where it is not exposed to wind chill or to direct sunlight as this can skew the reading. For me, the ideal location is under the awning on the porch or under the overhang on the back of the house, both places being protected from direct moisture and direct sunlight. Compared to the reading coming off the heat pump, the temperature readings tend to be lower because of the heat pump's exposure to direct sunlight.<br /><br />The display is nice and bright and is easy to read. I like being able to see it across the room and not have to either squint or approach it to read the time on it.<br /><br />So far I have no complaints with this clock. It works as expected and is very easy to set up. It's nice and bright too so it is easy to read.",1672916767350,0,false

4,Not a bad little wet vac,"I purchased this back in October.  It’s the 2nd wet vac I’ve bought.  The first one left lines where the belts were so it went bye bye.  I’ve been using a spin mop since to mop my floors. It seems not matter how carefully I vacuum first, I never get up all the pet hair which then gets tangled in the mop head virtually tending them useless after a couple uses.  I also wanted something that I could use as a quick clean without exerting the energy mopping takes.  So I have this a try.  I have 3 dogs and a cat so my wood floors see a lot of traffic from outside.  The water tank on this is really quite small, maybe 2 cups.  One tank would clean the approximate 700 square feet of wood I have.  When I’d change the water it would be mud dirty.  How can 2 cups of water and a little cleaner clean 700 square foot?  The answer is I don’t know but somehow it does.  At least it does it good enough to pass until I want to deep clean them with a mop.  It doesn’t get close to baseboards, but again I clean those areas when I mop. The power it has is adequate, however, if you have an old stuck on spill it’s not going to get it up, you’ll have to scrub it up with something.  I run it with the spot cleaner going as well for an added bit of power.  I’ve also found that spraying quick shine floor cleaner right from the bottle works way better than filling the tank.<br />Overall it’s not a bad little buy.",1674772621440,0,true

I was sure it would crack or something. Instead it bounced! That sucker hit the ground hard on a hardwood floor and not even a scratch. I don't know about the floor though LOL! I highly recommend. If you're going to make triple layer cakes go for something a little taller but it is great for a double layer cake and I use lots of fluffy whipped cream icing. Fits right over the top and I also cover the bottom with the cardboard cake rounds. I don't know if that's necessary but I figure if I ever want to use the bottom as a charcuterie tray I don't want to mix my meats and cake so as a precaution I use the cake rounds.

There also are some cleaning supplies; I haven't cleaned mine yet, but it cleans by shaving some stone off.<br /><br />At first, I was afraid of it being cold out of the shower. Yes, it's a bit cold, but not uncomfortable. Because of how quickly the mat absorbs water, the mat feels like room temperature almost immediately. By the time I get out of the shower and finish drying my body, the bottom of my feet are already dry on their own. The water takes a few minutes to be completely gone, but the mat works without fail.

This is a mattress cover, not padding. Expect it to do nothing to make an uncomfortable mattress better.  Further, I can assure you, it can do even less to make your bed cooler unless you are sleeping directly on your mattress.<br /><br />My first observation was that the stretchy mesh type material used for the sides is the type that will tear easily, especially if it has to be stuffed into a washing machine that isn't quite large enough.<br /><br />Secondly, the filling is very evenly distributed.  It is not nearly as puffy as the photos suggest. It irks me when sellers do this to people buying on line. I've had a heavily stuffed cover and didn't want another one.

5,The Perfect Pillow,"Boy oh boy, did I ever make one whopper of a mistake!<br /><br />This is one of the easiest reviews I've ever written.  The pillow arrived vacuum sealed. The instructions say to either let it sit in the sun for a number of hours (I apologize...I do not recall how many hours, I skipped over this step since its winter, cold and the sun wasn't out when the pillow was delivered lol) or put it in the dryer for 15 minutes which is precisely what I did. After 15 minutes...absolute perfection. The pillow was fluffed to the perfect height and firmness...like it had been custom made for me.  Don't worry-if it is too firm for you, simply unzip and remove some of the memory foam.<br /><br />The pillow is well made; no loose threads or tears.<br /><br />So...if the pillow is so perfect, what mistake did I make, you wonder?<br /><br />I ordered it for my husband. Its his. But I WANT IT! lololol.  I LOVE this pillow. Unfortunately, he loves it too. But all is not lost. He gets up very early for work, so once he's up its all mine.  lol.<br /><br />An excellent pillow...comfy, well made and good quality. The price is reasonable.",1678580875670,0,false
5,Frees Up A Lot of Room in the Closet,"Assembly is super easy (good instructions included) and fast. This is a 3 tier shoe rack.  More tiers can be added; its stackable. Though I don't really have any tall shoes, I like that a tier rod can be removed to make room for tall shoes/boots.<br /><br />The rack is very sturdy, doesn't wobble and  is lightweight. The bottom of the legs are skid-proof.<br /><br />I own a lot of sneakers. I can fit 12 pairs on the rack. Let me tell you, this has freed up a lot of room in the closet. (And you know what that means...more sneakers for me! lol)<br /><br />Great shoe rack, perfect for small closets, homes, apartments, dorm rooms, RVs. etc.  The price is reasonable.",1677221447318,0,false
5,"VERY Comfy, Maintains its Shape","I love this pillow. Its different and surprisingly comfortable.  It arrives vacuum sealed and quickly fluffs into place. You have a choice of 3 sizes/17 different colors. I chose the largest size-13.7"" in brown. Looks great on a lounger chair in the living room. Perfect for behind the back or head or even under the knees to prop legs up. Maintains its shape beautifully. Very well made with no loose threads/holes.  It is machine washable though I've not done so.<br /><br />Definitely worthy of gift giving.  Perfect for living rooms, bedrooms (adult or kids), offices, sofa, college dorms. The price is reasonable.",1677103138375,0,false
5,"Crushes Ice W/Ease, Impressively Strong/Powerful","Gotta say, I'm nothing but impressed and pleased with TIKBABA's personal blender! In all honesty, I wasn't expecting it to have as much power as it does.  I tried it out by making a smoothie...it crushed ice beautifully and with ease and did so quickly.  Also made a milkshake that turned out thick and creamy, exactly the way I like my milkshakes. Cleaning is fast and easy and thanks to the small size it doesn't take up much space in the cupboard.<br /><br />Its nice to no longer have to drag out the big blender when making an individual drink.  Perfect for individual drinks, travel, college dorms, RVs and definitely makes a nice gift.  I am REALLY looking forward to using this when summer arrives. I'm a huge fan of fresh smoothies and homemade juices with fruits/vegetables from my own garden.  This is truly an impressive individual blender. The price is definitely reasonable. I'm going to get A LOT of use out of this!",1677092689209,0,false
5,"Pretty, Soft and So Colorful","The dahlia is my absolute favorite flower.  I decorated one of the bathrooms in our home with various dahlia items and when I spotted this Nymphia dahlia bathroom rug, I snatched it right up!  It comes in three sizes: 18"" x 24"", 20"" x 32"", 24"" x60"". I went with the 18"" x 24"" and am now kicking myself for doing so. I should have gone with the 20"" x 32"".  That's my fault for ordering the wrong size. But I still LOVE this bathroom rug. Its well made , durable and soft. Absorbs water quickly and doesn't slide thanks to the non-slip bottom. The coloring is so bright and pretty.  Can go in the washer/dryer though I've not yet washed mine.<br /><br />I love it. I am considering buying another rug in a bigger size and if I do, I'll find somewhere for my current rug to be used. Its too pretty not to.  The price is reasonable.",1676939181963,0,false
5,Put Your Feet Up and Enjoy! Comfy W/Easy Assembly,"I knew I'd enjoy this chair after assembly was so easy! lol.  I had absolutely NO issues assembling and had it done in under 30 minutes.  At 18""D x 14""W x 5""H, its a nice size and comfy. I especially love and appreciate the ottoman. Nice to kick back and prop up my feet while watching TV. Very sturdy and it doesn't wobble or slide thanks to the non-skid foot pads. Has a convenient pocket, perfect for storing a TV remote or even the TV Guide.<br /><br />For now, the chair is in our bedroom but it'll be moved over to the rec room we're renovating once its finished. Perfect for a dorm or apartment.  Definitely worthy of gift giving. I will say, I initially thought the price was a bit high but I no longer feel that way. Its great quality, looks  nice and is very comfortable. I find the price reasonable.",1676673817812,1,false
5,"Fun, Unique and Comfy","At some point, you've probably ordered an item that arrives vacuum sealed.  But if you haven't, don't worry when your Petrella knot pillow arrives.  It'll look smooshed in the bag but once you cut it open (be careful you don't cut the pillow itself) and take the pillow out, it'll poof into place.  It is recommended the pillow sit in the sun for 3 days after removing from packaging to avoid wrinkles. Seeing as its winter, grey, cold and dreary, I wasn't able to follow the recommendation. The pillow isn't terribly wrinkled at all.<br /><br />Two sizes are available-8 and 11 inch. A variety of colors are as well. I chose the 11 inch, ivory shade.  I love how the pillow is soft and comfy yet at the same time firm enough to keep its shape. I originally planned on keeping it on the bed as a decorative pillow but after seeing it with the boatload of pillows already on the bed I decided to keep it on a chaise lounge in the living room.  It looks nice and works well as a back pillow on that particular chair.<br /><br />This is a unique and fun well -made pillow.  Perfect for bed, sofa, chair.  Definitely worthy of gift giving.  (Makes a nice house warming gift!) The price is reasonable.",1676263051891,1,false
5,Happy to Add This to My Collection!,"I love owls and couldn't wait for this onlyyou figurine to arrive. I must say, I did have a bit of a hard time trying to decide between the white and black owl. In the end, I went with the black figurine.  Glad I did. Its adorable  and I already got compliments on it.<br /><br />I like the small 3.54""L x 7.08""W x 5.51"" size.  Its crafted from resin material, sturdy (doesn't wobble!) and lightweight. The hand-painted colors look great together.<br /><br />Its definitely worthy of gift giving.  Suitable for pretty much anywhere...coffee table, shelf, bedroom, bathroom, living room, office, office desk, classroom, etc.  It arrived well packaged and in perfect condition.",1676024535969,0,false
5,"Easy to Assemble, Very Nice to Look At, Sturdy","As I carried the shipping box containing the shoe rack into the house the day it was delivered, I heard a lot of rattling from inside and let out a groan.  It sounded as though assembling the rack was going to be a project.  Boy, was I wrong. Took me about 20 minutes total and I didn't have any issues.  (I know its a cliche, but if I can assemble it, anyone can!)<br /><br />Its a very nice shoe rack-(nice enough that it can be in plain sight in a home, not hidden away in a closet) I like the natural wood sides. When fully expanded, it measures  34.4×14×9.6 inches and I am able to fit 8 pairs of shoes. Each 'level' can hold up to 50lbs. The bars (racks) are sturdy and do not bend/collapse, wobble or bounce around.<br /><br />This has helped to free up some closet space.  But I have a lot of shoes so I can see ordering probably 2 more racks at some point for my shoes as well as my husband's. Nice, well made rack, the price is reasonable.",1675194696231,1,false
5,"Fun For Movie Night/Sleepovers, Binge-Watching Your Fave Shows","What a fun item for movie night! Included are 6 snack trays and 12 popcorn bags.  Makes snacking easy, convenient and not messy.

Perfect for a family movie night, sleepovers, binge watching your favorite shows.  Also included is a coupon for a free movie rental from a RedBox kiosk.

5,"Pretty Easy to Assemble, Comfy and Has Good Features","My husband works at home and spends 10 hours a day in his office on the phone, in front of a computer. A comfortable chair while working is a definite must for him. So far, this fits the bill.<br /><br />Assembly was pretty easy. All of the hardware is included with the chair as well as instructions that were 'OK, but could have been better' (according to my husband).<br /><br />Overall, the chair is comfortable and the ergonomic design plays a big part in that.  The mesh backrest provides ample support, the as does the seat cushion which is softer than it appears.  Its easy to adjust the chair's height and angles. (There is even a tilt function -had to laugh at the description above  because it points out the tilt function allows you to take a nap in your chair during the work day. lol) Holds up to 250lbs.<br /><br />The chair is on wheels and can be rolled around easily. (Ours is on plastic to protect the carpet...rolls without issue)<br /><br />No price is showing on the listing so I cannot comment as to whether the price is reasonable. But  I can tell you this is  a comfy chair that is very sturdy, easy to adjust and pretty easy to assemble.",1674594277219,0,false
5,Going to Get A Lot of Use Out of This!,"Easy and convenient to use, this digital stand  dough mixer has a lot of nice features.  LED touchscreen, timer, 11 speeds, 3 accessories including: a dough hook, beater and 16 wire whisk.  It doesn't take up a ton of room (a good thing since my kitchen is pretty full to begin with!) and the noise level is impressively low.<br /><br />So far, I've only used it to make pizza dough but it was easy to use  and FAR more convenient than making the dough by hand. I'm looking forward to using it to make breads, cakes, cookies, rolls and so much more. I might even attempt homemade spaghetti! Definitely worthy of gift giving.",1674511584556,0,false
5,Faux Fur But Looks Like the Real Thing. SO Soft and Comfy,"Wow...such a soft, gorgeous blanket!  It arrives on a fancy hanger. At 50"" x 60"", its a great size to keep on a sofa, chair or bed. Does a fabulous job of keeping us warm.  It may be faux fur but it certainly looks and feels real.  Very well made, no loose threads, tears or holes anywhere to be found.  Comes in 5 different colors-I chose gray.  It is machine washable-machine wash on cold, tumble dry or hang to dry. I did wash/dry prior to the first use and had no issues.  Makes a nice gift.",1673404300412,0,false
5,"These Are Dangerous! SO Comfy, You Won't Want to Get Out of Bed!","Oh boy...are these sheets ever dangerous! Dangerous because you are NOT going to want to climb out of bed in the morning after sleeping on these!<br /><br />I washed the set prior to use as I always do. Had absolutely no issues. (Washed on cold/gentle cycle, tumble dry on low. Its recommended the sheets be removed as soon as the drying cycle is finished to decrease wrinkles and avoid using fabric softener/dryer balls) They fit our king size mattress like a glove. Easy to put on, easy to remove. My goodness, are they ever soft and airy.  I love that I don't get overheated with these sheets as I tend to with others.  On the flip side, my husband is always cold due to BP medication but these sheets keep him nice and warm. They really are a perfect balance....not too hot, not too cold.<br /><br />I almost didn't order this set. I'm pretty sold on Jersey cotton sheets but I figured it was time to try something new and I am SO very glad that I did.  You'll sleep like a baby on these and won't want to climb out of bed in the morning. Definitely worthy of gift giving!",1672787005327,0,false

The size to the rim is 8 oz, but there is a little rim inside that serves two purposes....one, it's a visual for a 6-oz fill so servings are consistent in each ramiken and aren't overfilled.....And, it allows straight stacking of the ramikens.  The ventible lid is a plus for refrigeration and reheating. The plastic is thick and appears sturdy for longevity.

4,Soft and Beautiful,These are covers are soft and beautiful. I purchased the 18x18 set and put 20x20 inserts in. I found the rule of thumb to be that you place a bigger insert in for a full looking pillow. If I would have put 18x18 inserts in the pillow cases they would not have been as fluffy or full looking. The only downfall I have with these cases would be their durability. The backing is quite thin as you can see in the picture. I can feel my pillow insert through the backing and can see the creases through the backing. The likely hood of these lasting a long time with kids and dogs is minimal. I do believe I may get 6 months to a year with these on my couch as regular use but I do not expect longer than that. I have not had to wash or treat them for stains so I an unsure how they hold up after being treated/ cleaned. All in all these are beautiful covers yet probably not suited for daily wear and tear.,1674143338937,0,true

It was wrinkled out of the package and I didn’t wash it so that was the reason for the 3 stars on the wrinkle portion. The color is as depicted.  It did fit the twin xl and actually was a little too large for it. Overall I am satisfied with the purchase.,1674996061737,0,true
2,Wouldn’t recommend,If you’re looking for a non slide rug don’t buy these. They slide really bad. Very cute but they do slide. Guess I’m going to have to keep looking. Every rug I like say will not slide but get them and they do😡,1677948030306,0,true

5,Great party organizer,"Whenever we have a party, I would put plastic silverware in plastic cups and plates and napkins on the table.  This caddy is perfect for hosting parties and everything is just so organized. Holds everything perfectly without using extra space on the table. It is very sturdy and well constructed. Great quality. It's heavy and strong. It's also big where it can hold a lot of items. It looks great and can be used for any event.",1678964877152,0,false
5,Great Handheld Vacuum,This BLACK+DECKER 8V MAX reviva Handheld Vacuum has a powerful suction. I use it to suck up dog hair and crumbs under the dinner table. It also does a great job at stairs since I hate lugging my regular vacuum up and down the stairs. Occasionally I need to stick my finger in to get all the hair and dirt out from the container. The battery charge lasted awhile as I went around the house sucking up hair. I only plan on using this for little jobs and so far it's great for what I need. I wish it came with a wall mount.,1676393922280,0,false
5,Great kitchen addition,Finally embarrassed enough where I don't want others to see my food-stained pot holders. It was time to get new ones. These are nice looking pot holders.

4,Works great but takes longer,"This is a great product.  Unlike my last toaster oven (that cooked quickly, but harshly), this one cooks much more like a real (convection oven) but it takes longer.  It cooks well and evenly.  It's about the size of my last toaster oven, but the inside is very large, much bigger than any toaster oven I've ever had.  My regular oven quit on me, so I've been using this one until my new one gets here.  A full-sized rotisserie chicken in a baking dish fit perfectly.  I was also able to fit a full 5 lb bag of potatoes in it to bake them (at a different time, of course).  It did a beautiful job baking the potatoes but took twice as long as a regular oven.  I have had it for months now and use it regularly.  I waited to review it until I tried the air fryer setting.  I tried it last night on frozen french fries.  I sprayed a little cooking spray on them.  It worked beautifully, but (again) took about 20 minutes (about double what a full oven would take).  It cooks very evenly, has a very large capacity (for it's size) but does take a long time to cook.  I love it though.  My last toaster oven heated everything quickly, but scorched things in the process.  It works for me.",1674576434954,2,true
5,Definitely worth buying,"These are very useful.  They're easy to put together and have enough of a pitch so that the cans roll easily. I needed to keep dog food cans handy, rotate them and I didn't want to keep cases around.  I have one stacked on top of the other, tucked into the corner of my kitchen counter.  I can fit 2 cases of dog food, the cans naturally rotate and it looks remarkably decent on the counter.  You barely notice they're there.  These are worth buying.",1674265413358,4,true
5,Great product,"I bought two.  I absolutely love them.  They are wonderful...beautiful wood, sturdy, nice design and a very nice color.  They look like nice pieces of furniture.  The design is excellent.  There are two levels of knobs on top (3 each) and a lower level (three knobs) in the middle.  You can fit lots of coats, rain jackets, etc. on top.  The middle layer is great for kid's jackets, umbrellas, scarves, hats, etc.  I use the middle layer for my dog's jackets (which never seemed to make it the closet).  Assembly is very easy.  The directions are very clear (with diagrams) and each piece is clearly labeled with a small (easily removeable) sticker with a letter (so you know which pieces to put where).  I am very happy with these.  Definitely worth buying.",1674263877307,0,true
5,Definitely a good choice,"I was doubtful about how the pattern would look, but it's very nice.  The quality is very good.  The material feels soft (almost like a soft cotton), not cheap or velvet like.  They are NOT thin or flimsy.  I was hesitant about the pattern, but the pictures do not do it justice.  It's very nice, not fancy, but definitely not cheap looking...very comfortable.  We ordered others before this that turned out to be cheap, thin, cheap looking shiny velvet.  Those were awful.  These are great.  Definitely the right choice.  We're very happy with them.",1673453606315,1,true

4,Good but not for all cabinets,"I hesitated about whether to do a 4 or 5 star review on this product.  It's well made and easy to use.  You get 10 of them, so it's a good deal; however, it didn't work on any of our cabinets.<br />The problem is the length of the device.  It's 7.25 inches long in total and would only work with cabinets where the handles are 5.5 inches apart or less.  I don't know if our cabinets are just spaced differently, but it wasn't long enough for any of them.<br />I was able to put two of them together to lock the cabinets, and that means there are only able to lock 5 cabinets rather than 10.  I looked at some other child locks that are a similar design and it seems these are about the same length, but I know I've used some others in the past that are much longer.<br />So, I knocked off a star because they can't be used on our cabinets, but they are as described and designed.  If you have handles that are 5.5 inches apart or less, these would work.  One of the pictures shows a dresser and there is no way these would allow you to lock the drawers on a stanard dresser so I finally decided that I'd give it 4 stars.  I know some people don't look at the 5 star review because they feel they may be biased, and so 4 stars might bet more viewers.  At the end of the day they do work as advertised it's just I never really thought to measure my cabinets and you need to do that before buying these or any other similar design.",1678297824734,0,false

5,Solid Unit,"I’m going to give it 5-star because it is a solid and heavy unit.<br />First the shipping box weighs a lot! Unless you are strong it will take two to move it inside<br />The product is extremely well packed and I did not have any damages or missing items<br />The instructions and hardware kit are well defined BUT in the end they only include 2-3 spare items (screws,etc)<br />Take your time and separate all the boards with labels visible<br />Go over the instructions completely then take your time and do one page at a time<br />Pay attention to the drawing holes for hardware installation. The unfinished edges will be for the back pieces so keep that in mind when assembling<br />I was NOT fond of the plastic fasteners used to secure the boards. I the past they were metal and held tight; during my assembly some would loosen and fall of; frustrating!<br />The fireplace insert was an easy install but I didn’t use all the parts to secure it: I guess if you had children they could push against it, hence the hardware to really keep it in place<br />The backboard install was nice because it’s in sections and not one piece . No nails just small screws which I like.<br />My doors fit great. One was perfect but the other needed a slight adjustment<br />Remote works great<br />When it’s on it has a really nice look; especially in a dark room<br />Do NOT use any power tools; especially drill<br />Take your time with a number two Phillips<br />There it is; I think a great product overall and if anything the fasteners would be the only issue",1676586388006,0,true

4,Thin blanket but it has 14ft power cord.,"I found 4 blankets that had 14ft power cords . This REAKS brand was on the thinner side but does warm quickly and the longer cord makes all the difference. This allows you to have the controller where you need it and not dangling off the bed halfway up. I do not understand why other companies only give 9 ft and you are always fumbling to find the controller. There are blankets that ARE softer and thicker but the short cords ruin it.<br />For around $30 for a twin blanket, I highly recommend this one.",1678735902479,1,true
3,Cord needs to be longer,"Biddeford blankets are always good quality BUT like so many heated blankets , the cord is not long enough to allow for convenient positioning of control. They should be between 13-14 feet and I’ve only found a handful of manufacturers who make them.",1678735409436,0,true
5,THE BEST pillow you’ll ever find.,"I have a lot of neck issues and fibromyalgia so it’s been a mission to find a great pillow and THIS is it.<br />The PURPLE pillow is very expensive but worth it. I’ve bought Tempurpedic pillows,  several  “adjustable”<br />Fill pillows and lots of others. Good pillows are not cheap . I use them a few times but end up giving them away because I don’t get quality rest.  Finally settled on PURPLE thin profile and it’s just right. I’m a petite woman so this size is perfect. Larger people may want a thicker one but these are like laying your head on a cloud . They do not have any weird odor and came with a zippered cover, though I would have expected a better quality than what I got. The pillow protector is thin and you see the purple through it.",1678734713870,0,true
5,Finally found the BEST mattress topper,"I bought a Tempurpedic mattress a few years ago and even though it was the softer model,  it was so hard and uncomfortable for me. I tried so many different kinds of pads and toppers and none did the job.<br />The heavy gel toppers were just that: heavy and too squishy. Finally I found THIS bamboo mattress pad/topper and I’m amazed at how it transformed my bed. This topper has padding spread evenly and it springs back without bunching up or going flat. For around $70 I consider this to be the answer I needed. I was almost ready yo BUY a new PURPLE mattress but this pad makes my Tempurpedic tolerable. I highly recommend it. Only negative is that it isn’t quite large enough so the padding doesn’t go all the way to the edge. The skirt does stretch so it stays in place.<br />PURPLE makes THE BEST bed pillow though.",1678734030967,0,false
5,"Finally,  a heated blanket  with longer cord.",Nice light blanket with extra LONG cord (14ft). Finally able to have control at reach and not way at bottom.<br />This blanket is quite lightweight so you  feel the electric wiring inside but it’s really no problem.<br />I do wish it was thicker but  it’s very soft.  This blanket heats very well and quickly. The drawback is that you have to scroll through all the heat levels to shut it off. But  for $30 it is good enough.,1678515567340,1,true

It off with my fingernails and it wouldn't even pull up at all so I was going to get the big guns out but thankfully I said something to my hubby and he said to leave it there, he didn't know it was there so now he will just avoided it.<br />My shower mat is really heavy so I'm so surprised how well this thing is holding.<br />I'm very happy with my purchase",1677685721702,2,true

The Sheet is warm, soft, and quite nice, if that's what you need. After getting over my anger at myself for not paying attention, I guess maybe I would order just the bottom cause it is warm to get into at first, and if you're a warm sleeper, maybe another warm sheet on top of you, maybe too much.

4,Can't believe they're this decent for such a reasonable price...,"My Mom's mid-late 90s couch... back when the quality couches were still made in USA (usually Tupelo, MS area or around Hickory, NC)... still has really good bones. But the fabric, a wine red + hunter green + navy blue tartan, is showing the decades of growing family and then growing grandkids. Bought these so I could repair what I could of the original fabric, and also launder and sanitize,  without rendering individual cushions 'out of commission' for a day or two.<br /><br />I tried the covers on to make sure they fit before laundering. She liked them. She also instructed me to order a set for her loveseat. The navy color I bought is close enough to the navy in their original fabric that it's indiscernible in their darker living room.<br /><br />I deducted 2 stars because these could stand to be maybe 1/2"" to 3/4"" wider, just so the seams line up on the top of her deep set cushions. Also, the clasp in the back is very thin plastic. It will break. Replacements in metal are sold at craft/fabric stores where they sell bra strap adjustment clasps. Finally, the elastic that is supposed to keep the replacement cover from shifting is too lax. It's also not got a lot of elasticity to it... it is like stretched out cheap elastic brand new. I can fix all of these issues for us, but not everyone has that luxury, thus the deduction of 2 stars and not one.<br /><br />If I have any future issues (seams coming apart, etc.) I'll update this review.",1677711173681,0,true

5,I love this table cloth!,"It's beautiful, I get compliments from everyone that comes over. It Resists spills and stains. When it needs washing, I pretreat, toss in washer and dryer.

5,Great for the arthritis pain in my neck.,This is my second My Pillow. My hubby got me one ten years ago from Walmart. It was getting somewhat worn down but the main reason for getting the better one is herniated disc and arthritis in my neck and shoulders.<br /><br />This is a little fuller/ firmer than I expected but I think that's because my other one was smaller and strangest fill.<br /><br />These are great for side sleepers.  I've even woke up on my back and it felt great. These would make great gifts for anyone with neck issues or just overall great gift.  I love these pillows and an considering getting the mattress topper next,1673663049292,0,true

3,Good for Storing and Serving Oils and Syrups,"Olive oil, vegetable oil, and other oils and syrups are common to all households. You can always pour what you need straight from the bottle you purchased at the store, but a good alternative is this PARACITY Glass Oil Dispenser.<br /><br />This small pitcher holds about 20 ounces and can be used for most any type of oil. The opening on the top is large enough that you can easily pour the contents of a store bottle into the pitcher without spilling. The pitcher even has milliliter measurement markings, which can be useful in some instances.<br /><br />As for its design, this is a practical container and I like that the opening on top is large enough that you don’t need a funnel. The spout is small, and I wonder if a thicker liquid could be poured from here without any problem. I’m likely going to use this pitcher for olive oil, since that is something we use frequently in my household. I have considered pancake syrup, but the thickness might be an issue.<br /><br />The markings on the side of this container can be useful, but there are no ounce markings, only milliliters, so be ready to convert, if necessary. There is also a small plug that comes with this, to block the opening on the spout and keep things from getting in through the small opening. This is a good idea, but it’s only a matter of time until this small plug gets lost. When that happens, you will need to cover it with a small piece of plastic wrap or something similar. Also, the glass seems thin, so one needs to be careful or else this will break.<br /><br />I like having small contraptions around the kitchen for storing and serving. This glass oil dispenser is good to have around, although certainly not a necessity, since store- bought containers are just as convenient. It seems fragile, but it’s still got enough going for it to recommend.",1678471286552,0,false
4,Decorative Candles for Your Home,"One thing I can’t seem to get enough of in my household is candles. I like them for their decorative qualities and for the warm glow of light that they emit. Some candles have more decorative qualities than others, like these Chinese Dragon and Phoenix Wedding Candles from Zingzihome.<br /><br />You get a pair of candles with this package and, fortunately, mine were not broken when they arrived. I saw the disclaimer, from the manufacturer, that this could happen but mine were in good shape, ready to display.<br /><br />What stands out most with these candles is the Chinese dragon design. They are recommended for special events, but they can be used for other purposes. I have placed mine on my fireplace mantle, where they standout due to the eye- catching, artful design and the height. They are about 10 inches tall so they easily tower above my other candles.<br /><br />One small problem I noticed with these candles is that they do not stand straight up. They are slightly bent. They are still close enough to straight, so I ca tolerate this imperfection. They burn odorless, too, so they make a good choice when you want a candle that doesn’t emit the scent of berries, flowers, etc. I like how these candles look and recommend a pair to anyone, either for celebrations or for a decorative display.",1678304465739,0,false
4,Good Means to Easy Air Frying,"Our air fryer is one of our most- used appliances. Air fryers work well when you have food that is already prepared and just needs to be heated, but one issue we have is with finding the right containers for use inside the air fryer. The answer to our needs is this 2-Pack Air Fryer Silicone Pot set.<br /><br />You get a pair of pots with this set, plus two small silicone gloves to protect your skin. The pans measure about 8 inches on a side and one surprise to me is that they are flexible in design. I didn’t know this when I placed the order. I thought they were solid pans and I wasn’t so sure I liked this, when I found out. But after a use or two, I decided the flexible nature is okay.<br /><br />One advantage of the soft flexibility is that these air fryer pans are easy to store. You can fold them up if you need to, and squeeze them into a small space inside a kitchen drawer. Most important of all, they work well for heating up food. There is no plastic or other flavor transferred to your food. This was a concern at first, but that worry was quickly laid to rest.<br /><br />We like our air fryer and continue to use it whenever we can. These silicone pots are good for most any air fryer. They serve as a container for your food that is better than using metal because there is less chance of burning and there is no transfer of plastic or other off flavors to your food. They are a nice addition to our accessories and hopefully, they will help keep my air fryer clean and thereby extend its life.",1677980965802,0,false
4,Adds to the Fun Day of Celebration,"My teenager is very close to the end of her high school career. She and I are gearing up for the big day and we plan on several celebrations. Food is certain to be part of the events and thus we need napkins. These Graduation Party Disposable Paper Napkins fulfill that need.<br /><br />Colorful and fun, these napkins come 50 to the pack and can be used for either college or high school graduation. They have a few symbols on the side of each napkin along with the generic phrase, Congrats Grad. This makes them useful for any type of education- related graduation. I got the red- colored ones because my kid’s high school colors are red and white. They match her other high school accessories.<br /><br />These napkins are three- ply and measure 6.5 inches square, but you can unfold each, creating a large paper napkin measuring 13 inches on a side. Each of the four faces of the napkin, when unfolded, has the colors and words. The napkins are disposable and while they may not be super- absorbent, they are good for a napkin. They are not intended as a substitute for paper towels, so one needs to bear that in mind.<br /><br />Graduation will be here in no time. Decorations and accessories for the special day are essential and with this set of graduation napkins, I have one more item I can check off the list.",1677705166371,0,false
5,Comfort for Your Time in the Office,"When you spend a good deal of your day staring at a computer screen, you need a good office chair. My previous chair was fine for short stints, but it wasn’t very comfortable for longer durations. I needed a new office chair and my selection was this Home Office Chair with Adjustable Headrest and Retractable Footrest.<br /><br />This chair was designed with comfort in mind. It has a mesh backing, to help keep you cool, a head rest, arms that move in multiple directions, adjustable height, and more. You can lean back in this char with ease and the rocking ability is relaxing. It would be much easier to fall asleep in this office chair than in my old one.<br /><br />A surprise feature with this office chair is the footrest! Had I not read other reviews, I wouldn’t have even realized it was there. It is hidden from normal view. It pulls out from the seat, and you then unfold and extend. It doesn’t extend as far as I would prefer and since I use my office chair mostly while working, I doubt I will use it much. Still, it’s a nice extra feature you don’t find in most office chairs.<br /><br />One other thing to note about this chair is that the assembly and directions are quite easy. I like how each of the sets of bolts are in their own plastic compartment and I like how they are labeled to tell you which ones to use in each of the six numbered steps. It is also helpful that there are labels on the base of the seat and the arm rests to tell you which direction is the front of the chair. This helps prevent the accidental placement of the arm rests in the wrong direction.<br /><br />This office chair is heavier than other office chairs. It is quite an improvement compared to other office chairs I have used, and it earns an easy recommendation from me.",1677341410417,0,false
4,Realistic Looking Tree for my Office Space,"My workplace office is decorated primarily with outdoor photos and artificial plants. Real plants are great, but I prefer artificial plants in my office space because they require no care. The more realistic they look, the better. With an empty space to fill on my office floor, I decided to get this 5 ft Artificial Eucalyptus Tree.<br /><br />Double boxed to keep it safe on delivery, this tree has two pieces that need to be attached together. Once you place the top half into the bottom trunk, it is ready to display. All you need to do is smooth out the branches and then turn it whichever way you like. It will look different depending on the way you place it because the branches are not evenly distributed on each side.<br /><br />When I was attempting to spread out the branches, I quickly discovered that some of the branches are fragile and they pop right off! I was surprised by this at first and couldn’t believe the tree was already falling apart. But then I noticed that the detached branch could easily be pushed right back into its place. Thus, it wasn’t really broken in the sense that I thought it was.<br /><br />This tree does have a realistic look to it, as long as you ignore the base. No tree of this size could realistically fit inside such a tiny base and still grow like normal. But that’s a minor issue. The tree itself is what matters and other than the issue with the breaking branches, this eucalyptus tree looks good in my office and is perfect for those who like plants but don’t like taking care of them.",1677006676454,0,false
5,What is Your Lid Preference?,"We use lots of water bottles in my household. Over time, I have slowly replaced plastic bottles with stainless steel and my most recent addition is this BJPKPK Insulated Water Bottle.<br /><br />The standout with this water bottle is the included three lids. You get a solid lid, that screws tightly shut and must be removed to get to the liquid within; a lid with a flip- up opening that requires the use of one of the included straws to drink; and a spout- style lid. Of the three, I prefer the spout lid but I like having the three options, and so do my kids.<br /><br />This water bottle is made from metal, so it is designed to last. It can handle hot or cold beverages, but I have used mine exclusively for cold drinks so far. The insulation is sufficient to keep drinks cold for a while. The manufacturer claims up to 24 hours, but I cannot vouch for that, since I usually consume the contents within about three hours.<br /><br />You get 22 oz of space with this water bottle. That is enough to hold a healthy size serving of your favorite beverage. I like what I have experienced so far and I especially like the three different lid options, and thus give this water bottle my highest rating.",1676923659082,0,false
4,Air Fryer and Much More,"If you have something to cook/heat that requires a small space, it doesn’t make sense to heat up your regular oven. A smaller oven will do the trick more quickly and save energy, and that is reason to consider this Nuwave Bravo Convection Oven 1800-watt Smart Air Fryer.<br /><br />I decided to get this oven as a replacement for the small air fryer we were using. I found that this oven takes a little longer to preheat, but that is only because of its larger size compared to my old air fryer. It is still fast and much quicker than waiting for my full size oven to heat up. Using the air fryer resulted in prepared frozen food in about 8 minutes. And the food was ready to go, heated thoroughly but not overdone.<br /><br />My first few attempts using this oven did take some effort, just to learn the settings. I expected it to sound off a tone or something when the desired temp was reached, but it doesn’t do that. You just have to look and when you notice the coils are no longer red hot, it’s ready to go. The timer countdown shows the minutes only, then shows the seconds remaining when it gets below the one minute mark. Again, these are things you need to learn, but it won’t take long.<br /><br />Air frying is just one of this oven’s many functions. It can do much more and in due time, I will attempt many more cooking functions. For now, the air frying seems to work well, but it does make somewhat of a mess so you need to be prepared to clean after each use. With my other air fryer, the mess seemed a little more manageable. Or, maybe we just weren’t cleaning it as frequently as we should!<br /><br />It's good when you save energy in the kitchen and still get your food prepared the way you like it. This Nuwave oven is a good one overall, capable of air frying and much, much more. It’s a good choice when your space is limited or if you just want to cook food a little faster and not heat up a full size oven for a small meal.",1674949948347,1,false
4,Good Multi Use Tote Bags,"When you gift someone a bottle of wine or other beverages, it helps with you can present the gift either wrapped, or at least in a gift bag. Even if the bag is plain with no writing or fancy design, it still serves the purpose and a good example is this set of gift bags from Dasonfine.<br /><br />You get 12 bags with this set. The bags are dark red in color, just like a burgundy wine. Each bag is tall and narrow with a handle for easy carrying. And with the flat, rectangular bottom, the bag stands up with ease assuming the bottle inside is flat on the bottom, as most are.<br /><br />These bags seem durable and they should have no problem being used and reused. The material isn’t super strong, but it doesn’t need to be. The inside of the bags is small enough that you really can’t overload it. And nothing says you have to use these for wine. Any gift that is tall and narrow can fit inside. You could use them for small crafts, too.<br /><br />I don’t normally gift wine, but I do gift bottles of booze and other drinks. These reusable bags are good for gifting and other uses and they should last a good long time.",1674523247427,0,false

5,Worth the money,"At first I was undecided on the my pillow I decided to give it a fair shot and after about 2 nights,it indeed is worth the money. Yes its comfortable sleeps well.

5,Used for 4 months,I absolutely love this topper it makes my bed wayyy more comfortable. You just sink right into it and it comforts my curves. I broke my back last year and this has been a life saver for my sleep. The thickness is perfect and the durability it great. I move around in my sleep really really bad so the topper does slip to the sides and to the bottom often but I don't find it hard to redo. This mattress topper is the best one I could've bought.

You can feel the cords it it but after 3 months you get used to them. At first my mom said she would never use it and to return it but then after 3 days she loved it and has been using it daily!

2,Color Quality is not very Good - Thinking about returning all 7 rugs,"I purchased rugs for 2 bathrooms, one bathroom in a dark blue/white and the other bathroom in a lighter blue/white.  I should note that all of the rugs were ordered and received at the same time.<br /><br />Example of poor quality in color:  For both bathrooms the following is true:  if I put all of the rugs side by side for the first bathroom the color variation is very obvious, in fact some of the navy blue/white rugs match the rugs I purchased for the other bathroom, in a lighter blue.<br /><br />Ordered 7, different size, rugs at the same time...Paid $245.00 when ordered...At an average of $35.00 per rug, average size of rug is 34"" x 22"" - not a very large rug.  Because of the size required for each double sink/cabinet area I had to put 2 rugs at each...I would be willing to pay more if the sized required were availble...But longer sizes were not available from any company even at a higher price.<br /><br />I am still thinking about returning ALL 7 rugs...I don't return much from Amazon, probably returned 5 items in the past 4-5 years.  Very disappointed, just be aware!",1673899821973,0,true

5,Easy to use espresso machine,"I love this espresso machine.  It has a little bit of a learning curve to figure out the settings I like best, but it is really easy to use.  I followed the suggestion from other reviews and just brewed and dumped the first dozen or so cups of coffee (they were watery anyway).  Then the machine worked great (no watery coffee).  The froth option works great with the nut milks that I prefer, and the hot water feature is even hot enough to use for hot tea (and the water does not taste like coffee flavored water either).  The ground coffee bypass option is easy to use and great for switching to decaf coffee.  The only cons I've noticed so far are that the water tank seems to always need refilling even though it is not actually empty and the hot water option does not dispense the same amount of water consistently.",1673967905710,0,true

5,Awesome for watching tv,This is described as a headboard which I understand because we have a bed that is a platform and does not have a headboard. This works well for that but we only put it there to try it. We purchased this to go with the folding mattress that I bought on Amazon also. That mattress is a trifold and we use it in front of the tv on the floor essentially as another couch. We love having movie night but everyone wants their own lay down space. The mattress is awesome but needs a booster for the head as pillows just don’t give the right steel angle to watch tv.<br />This came in a small package but opens up to be large in a twin size. It is super soft and comfortable and works so well with the mattress as a portable headboard.  They fight over this to watch tv.<br />My recommendation is to purchase something like Febreze and let this air out for a few days after taking it out of the package.this has the same odor as the mattress and airing it out on the deck cleared this up. This will be spot cleaned but it seems water repellent. It is a great pillow and I think that it would be perfect for a dorm room.,1676850651375,1,true
5,Very comfortable,We needed an additional cushioned area in our living room when we have a large group hanging out. I looked at many and found a chair that folds into a mattress such as this and purchased it. It is fine but we don’t need another chair and we need more comfortable room on the floor for kids hanging out. After looking at a lot of different models and researching the reviews I chose this. I like the storage bag which makes it much more compact. It could be stored in the box also as it is a nice size. I got the full and it is large enough for entertaining yet still folds away nicely. It is quite heavy and I believe that it is the 4 inches that it states. Comfort was a great concern and kids are fighting for it so I think that it is comfortable. The material seems breathable and I hope that it doesn’t snag or rip but we put a blanket on it so it will be fine. It does not sit up like a chair like I had wished but we can make it happen when leaving on a coffee table.  There is an odor when you take it out if the box which subsided with airing out and Febreze.  I think it is a great addition to watch tv with a group.,1674584858653,3,true
5,Sturdy Tumbler!,"If you have petite hands, this may be a little big for you. The cup is well made. The lid fits securely. The opening tab flips back and forth, and shuts well. Better than those other lids that have the slide opening. The slide ones always seem to gather gunk beneath the sliding part. Gross. Not with this one! I can fit my large hand inside to clean. Haven't tried to measure how many ounces it truly holds, but I'm not too concerned with that. It holds enough. The measuring marks on the inside are a nice touch. Can't tell you if it's spill proof, because the cat hasn't knocked it off the table yet. The straw has a ridge preventing it from falling out if it tips over. Very impressed! Haven't measured the heating or cooling properties, but I'm sure they're there. Solid cup!",1678390103180,0,true

5,Great trash can,"Purchased jan 2020.<br /><br />3yrs using this trash can, just wanted to say still works just like day it arrived.

I purchased the adapter plug as it eats batteries so spend the money and get the plug it’s so much easier.<br /><br />Overall cans been wonderful and when this one dies eventually I’ll get another in stainless instead of white to match better.. but I have zero complaints on this and 3yrs with no issues in a electronic garbage can is a good sign as it’s used daily multiple times think how many times you throw something away it adds up to lid coming up and down and still going.. worth every dollar just based on its durability in my opinion.",1675585743399,0,false

5,"A superb pan, but definitely NOT dishwasher safe","I have a lot of All-Clad stuff, D3 and D5. NONE of it goes in the dishwasher. The middle layer is susceptible to  the corrosive effects of dishwasher detergent, which is typically a lot more harsh than you might expect. Absolutely do not put these in the dishwasher. All-clad has stopped telling people these can go in the dishwasher, and now says hand-wash recommended. Trust me, hand wash only. Get yourself a good scrub brush, a can of BKF, and learn how to care for your pans properly by soaking/boiling after use (and after cooling) to allow you to clean them easily and quickly. Lots of good videos online for this. I cannot stress this enough: no dishwasher for any multi-ply cookware.<br /><br />As for the cooking properties of this pan, these are superb. Not as good as a D5 5-ply, but leaps and bounds better than almost everything else out there. Very good heat distribution (the point of multi-ply SS cookware), and brilliant and producing fond. Great handles too - easy to hold on to. If you care for your AC multi-ply cookware properly, you will be able to leave it your children. This is the good stuff.",1678518008128,0,false

I hope it works well, but expectations are low. It is extremely lightweight and will move around a LOT during use. No rubber feet or anything--it will just slide around. Super-cheap. Feels like dollar-store junk. Should have followed my instincts and picked up a small cast iron tortilla press for this task instead. Not worth the trouble of returning for $9. I'll try it, and if it sucks, I'll recycle it. Cannot recommend. Save your money--buy something better in the first place.",1678168637586,0,true

You can always be certain what you are weighting is accurate.  The display is clear and the scale is simple to operate.

5,Great sprayer,"I've purchased around 7 sprayers over the last few years that either didn't work well out of the box or only worked for a few days and quit (the nozzle gummed up and just spattered out oil).<br /><br />I love that that this sprayer sprays in a fan pattern. It’s not perfect as the oil seems to spray heavier on the ends, but it does very well.<br /><br />[Pro Tip] The key for proper use is to only use the sprayer full force in order to get the best fan shaped spray. If you try to go lightly, it will just cause it to drip. I kept finding that light caused the drip, so I tested the volume per spray and found that one spray is indeed equal to 1/4 teaspoon of oil, or 4 sprays per teaspoon (partial sprays throws this off). You’ll be amazed how much you can cover/coat with one teaspoon of oil.<br /><br />This is also perfect for air frying, which works best with a small amount of oil (food tends to dry out or stick). Again, it’s not perfect, but it is the very best oil sprayer out there, and I’ve tried a lot.<br /><br />This oil sprayer makes my life so much easier (I usually use Olive Oil which is slightly more dense than canola/vegetable). I work in a fast paced environment, and am rushing to get dinner ready every night. I can spray this on my chicken or fish prior to baking, or air fry it, and it works like magic.<br /><br />No more having to buy canned sprayers and then dealing with disposing them (or hoping for the best when I toss them). Very pleased!",1678459935770,0,true

5,I’m a compost newbie in Southern California,"My daughter and I live in Southern California, and we recently received word that there will be mandatory composting of food scraps for our trash pickup. We live in a townhome and our little “green” barrel was delivered two weeks ago.<br /><br />We are totally willing to give this a try, but there is a bit of a learning curve after spending years either throwing scraps in the trash or running them down the garbage disposal. (Note that there is also a water shortage in our area, so suddenly using a lot of water running a garbage disposal isn’t so appealing.)<br /><br />I wanted a compost scrap bin for our kitchen that isn’t enormous and closes with a hinged lid, so I can open one-handed and drop my food in.<br /><br />We were told we could just drop food “as is” in the green barrel with no bag, but I’m not at that level of confidence yet. I purchased compostable bags (2.5 gallon, just like the bin) and they fit the bin nicely. This way I don’t have to worry about cleaning a big mess out of my green barrel or my bin each week. I decided on bags with handles so they can be tied up properly.<br /><br />After a couple of weeks of dropping food in this bin, I couldn’t be happier. We don’t tend to waste a lot of food, but certainly it is great for eggs shells, fruit rinds, spoiled food left too long in the fridge. It does make us think more about what can go in there and how to avoid waste. I’m still figuring all that out.<br /><br />This particular bin is almost the same shade as my cabinets, though maybe just a bit more on the cream side. The finish is not a shiny cheap plastic look but more matte…which I think is nice looking.<br /><br />I was happy that the “blue” accents on this bin are really darker and don’t show too blue. It could really pass as a dusty black.<br /><br />The lid can either be flipped up or brought forward and down…which is my favorite position. I think it allows for a wider dumping opening on top. The little “leather” pull-tab is a great functional feature and easy for me to grab.<br /><br />We have easily moved it around quite a bit, based on what we are doing in the kitchen. It fits nicely over the cabinet door and can even turn it to face the inside of the cabinet…assuming nothing is stored there that will block it.<br /><br />it came with a strip of adhesive if that is your preference, but I’m happy with the hinge for hanging over the cabinet door, since we like moving it around.<br /><br />If one were working on a bigger food project, it can easily be placed on the counter. Little rubber feet help keep it in place.<br /><br />This bin is sturdy and stylish…well-made and light-weight. It can easily be moved around with one hand, if it’s not holding a ton of food scraps.<br /><br />I have not noticed any odors so far and the lid seems to have a nice, tight fit.<br /><br />It’s certainly easy to open the lid, tie up the bag of scraps and toss the bag in my green barrel. Not hard to put a new bag in. Very easy to clean this bin when necessary.<br /><br />This bin came in a box (as pictured by the seller) that said bags would come with the bin. They were NOT in the box, but I have seen that comment in other reviews so expected it. I didn’t really care since I don’t think they are compostable…and that’s the whole point, right?<br /><br />I am very pleased with my purchase and feel it is a good value.",1676164555127,0,true
5,Exceeded my expectations,"My daughter “insisted” we buy this large 30-inch lighted wreath at Costco for Christmas and, of course, these large wreaths are not inexpensive.<br /><br />I have purchased wreath bags before but found them to always be on the flimsy side, which I think makes them hard to manipulate and store.<br /><br />I am the opposite of a lot of people…I do NOT want this container to be red or green. I’ve worked hard to make my garage a pleasant place to be in and this blue case really appealed to me. It’s certainly easy enough to tell what it is without having it be a bright red or green color.<br /><br />This is not the same as a “hard shell” container that protects well but has no flexibility.<br /><br />This case is flexible with its sturdy sides and bottom which should protect my investment properly. When I pick it up, it maintains its shape and would be easy to store flat on a shelf in my garage or hang from the strap.<br /><br />My 30-inch wreath fit nicely in this case and I will have room for another small wreath on top.<br /><br />The center has a separate generous-sized bag that would be great for holding cords or remotes. Maybe extra bulbs or instructions.<br /><br />There are straps and velcro inside to hold everything in place. And nice padded handle outside and a place to insert a card to remind you what is being stored.<br /><br />Two good-quality zippers close the top flap which has one side still attached…plenty of room to maneuver the wreaths around.<br /><br />I have no worries about storing it in my garage since the case appears to be water resistant. A nice study material.<br /><br />I’m thrilled with the quality of this case and will certainly consider buying again or even more of the various products provided by the company.",1675036099541,0,true
5,We bought these for ourselves and then as gifts,"My adult daughter and I each bought one of these glass tumblers but she has basically taken over using both of them. The deeper coral pink and lighter pink are both very pretty.<br /><br />They wash well in the dishwasher though she may wash the tops by hand to protect the wood.<br /><br />She drinks water, soda, wine and coffee out of them. She even has had no problem re-heating her coffee for a few seconds in the microwave. (I would test that carefully, though since microwaves do vary in power.)<br /><br />The textured silicone protective sleeves makes it comfortable to hold and gives a nice grip. We have used other straws and the lid accommodates all that we have tried. The lid also does provide a nice seal.<br /><br />I decided to give a gray version to my niece and nephew…and they were thrilled.<br /><br />Not only a functional alternative to a plastic water bottle but attractive to have around.<br /><br />I feel that the value is good and will continue to purchase. Maybe I can finally get one to call my own!",1674191109987,0,true
5,I use this to clean the top of my tall mirrors,"My master bath has two tall mirrors in it and are they very hard for me to reach when cleaning them.<br /><br />I could drag out a ladder or tall step stool, but I have found that attaching an inexpensive microfiber cloth to the red pad on this oxo scrubber works very well…since the red sponge on this scrubber has a rougher texture to it, it holds the cloth securely.<br /><br />I just spray my mirrors and go over them with the cloth attached to the scrubber pad. Because the red pad has some angles to it, my cleaning cloth gets in all the curves and corners of my mirrors. I also have no problem with streaks on the mirror, since using this microfiber cloth helps with that.<br /><br />This scrubber by itself is,  of course, great for cleaning other areas like tile tubs and shower walls.<br /><br />The telescoping handle is a great option for those hard-to-reach spots. What a back-saver!<br /><br />Once the red pad starts to show some wear, there are replacement pads available to purchase. I actually have one of these “handle with pad” tools on each floor of my two-story home. I hang it on a command hook for brooms and the pad angles so the whole unit flattens out to fit against the wall. I store the upstairs device in my master closet on the broom holder…it’s totally out of the way.<br /><br />I think this is a great OXO product and you may find many ways to use it. Maybe even washing those hard-to-reach spots on your windshield or high corners in you house.<br /><br />I highly recommend and find it a good value.",1673842204224,0,true
5,These spoons really save me time and energy,"For years I have avoided grapefruit because it has always been so time-consuming to cut. Why did I wait so long to get these spoons?<br /><br />Formerly I would cut each grapefruit section on all three sides and then spoon it out. Isn’t really that hard but it sure does take some time. Now I just push this spoon in and it pops the section up. So much faster and…I might add…more satisfying.<br /><br />These spoons are a pretty nice quality and weight. My regular spoons are the same length and weight in comparison…this spoon is just a bit more narrow so that it fits in the grapefruit section like it should.<br /><br />I just pop them in the dishwasher with my other flatware, when it’s time to cleanup.<br /><br />The long, narrow serrated knife is a nice addition, if I want to use that for cutting the fruit in half. This will come in handy for many things (like other fruit) that need to be cut in half.<br /><br />Overall, I think this is a great value and good quality. I would buy again and might add this to my gift ideas list when shopping for others.",1672794311416,0,true

It was easy to put the fitted bottom sheet on my deep mattress.  Also purchased a set for my daughter.  Nice selection of colors.,1674291076016,0,false
5,Where have these been ?,I like how they have that clean simple look. The way they feel when using them is really nice they are just right. Not too big or bulky or too small the size is excellent. They feel strong and made to last which is what I want. I got these to use in my electric skillet because all I have are just plain metal ones. I wanted something durable and that would scratch these will are really trick. First time using the small one I made oatmeal in my electric skillet. Cannot wait to use the big slotted one for grilled cheese or eggs. I highly recommend these I will write more about them when I get to try them more. Buy a set and see I would love to get a set of this brands spoons and other spatulas if they all are this nice.,1673026048950,0,true
4,Just ok,"Cons:<br /> I did not like how when I first washed it there was a copper color on the wash cloth.<br /><br />Horrible odor and smoke when I did the first heating. Very toxic odors.<br /><br />Took there heat cycles, and two washes for it to stop stinkng and smoking.<br /><br />A royal pain to wash all the styrofoam particles out of the edges of the glass lid.<br /><br />Horrible visibility of temperature setting on the switch you have to look under the handle.<br /><br />Not easy to clean and absolutely not dishwasher safe as the advertisement says.<br /><br />Sadly its made in China and probably doesn’t meet American safety or health standards. I doubt it will last a year.<br /><br />Sadly there are no more cast aluminum electric skillets produced in the USA.<br /><br />Pro's:<br /><br />Cooks great after you let it warm up 5 minutes.<br /><br />Saves you time.<br /><br />Lots of recipes to choose from.<br /><br />Lots of creative recipes if you do an internet search even cake go figure.<br /><br />Makes good gravy.<br /><br />Saves space.<br /><br />I give it 1 star for being Chinese made. The other 3 stars are because it works good.<br /><br />Hopefully an American company like All American can start casting these again because the old aluminum ones were the best and lasted forever.",1672845335438,14,true

5,Made crispy homemade fries,"We usually use foil sheets in our air fryer for easy clean up. But since the day could come that we have no more foil sheets, I was looking for some alternatives. I'd already tried parchment and didn't like it much.<br /><br />These silicone baskets are easy to clean and easy to use. (Not easy to store though.)<br /><br />My daughter likes to make homemade french fries in the air fryer. So, she tried out this silicone basket with her fries. They turned out better than with the foil. We got a ""before"" photo, but the fries turned out so well that I never got an ""after"" photo - those fries were GONE! But my daughter claimed they got crispier in this silicone basket.<br /><br />We have the 5.8 qt Cosori air fryer, and these baskets fit in there just fine. We loved the bright colors too.<br /><br />Overall, happy with these. We'll try air-frying chicken in them next.",1674189173614,0,false
5,Great insulated lunch bag,"What a great little bag!<br />This is very well made. The insulated layer will definitely help keep your lunch cold!<br /><br />The color is similar to blue jeans.

There is an additional zippered pocket on the outside as well.<br /><br />Overall, we love this one and would definitely buy it again. Great job by the manufacturer.",1674096160421,0,false
5,"Great bag, well made, plenty of carry options","Ok, this is a great lunch bag. We both liked the longer strap, so it could be put over your shoulder as needed.<br /><br />The bag itself has a nice outer fabric that is the color of blue jeans. The insulation is nice and thick. Now, the insert photos show a mesh pouch for holding things like silverware or napkins, but the one we received did NOT have that mesh. I don't know if it was an error, or if they maybe stopped including the pocket.<br /><br />The sections are nice and deep, and easily hold a bottle of water or can of soda. There is one outside pocket, I guess for a water bottle in theory. However, our regular water bottles did not fit. We happed to have a lifewater, whose bottles are thinner, and they did fit, although it was still a tight fit.<br /><br />There is a clasp so you could attach it to a backpack if desired.<br /><br />Overall, this is a well-made insulated bag. Very happy with it. Love the strap options on this version.",1674095894722,0,false

Simple idea, but effective.<br /><br />The plastic is a decent 5ml thick. The bag says it is ""gusseted"", so basically, a rectangular box you slide your mattress into.<br /><br />Overall, this is a very good idea, and I'll be using it next time we move.",1672879696000,0,false
4,"Could be stronger, but handy to have on hand.","While we love our dryers, sometimes we need an alternative for drying clothes. If you have your own backyard, you can pretty easily put in a clothesline.<br /><br />But, for those of us in apartments, we don't have those options. This is where this item comes in handy. You can attach this over your bathtub or shower and easily clip lighter-weight items for drying. I wouldn't hang heavy stuff with them, but it will definitely handle ""unmentionables"" and lighter clothing.<br /><br />The manufacturer markets it as a travel clothesline, and it could certainly be used for that as well.<br /><br />Always a good idea to have this item on hand, even if you never need it, than to wish you had one.",1672874552884,0,false
4,"Cut oddly, but so cute","We are big Doctor Who fans at our house.<br />So why not try an apron too?<br /><br />The print and fabric are great. The design is so cute. The straps could be longer.<br />The weirdest part is how this is cut in the chest area. If you are a busty lass, this apron will kind of cut you off, trying to send your tatas east and west, instead of covering them for protection from splatters or food spills.<br /><br />So, other than the poor cut in the breast area, it is really cute.",1672869832931,0,false

Upgrade your choice to a little better product.",1675854863930,0,true
3,Stuck together right out of the box,"All of these were so tightly stuck together in the box we had to pry them apart with a screwdriver. Needless to say it damaged one of the shelves, so their packaging leave a lot to be desired.<br />In all honesty these could have holes for optional hanging or magnetic use. Our fridge, turns out, doesn’t have enough clearance on the sides and that probably isn’t uncommon.<br />Most people wouldn’t have a choice but to use these elsewhere leaving you to have to drill holes or use the magnetic sticks on the wall. It would work but the aesthetic’s aren’t great.<br />I probably wouldn’t purchase this again knowing what I do. I would look for one that can be mounted multiple ways.",1673958876844,0,true
5,My favorite pan for pancakes ...,"I've been gradually adding to my Blue Diamond collection over the past couple of years, and finally got around to purchasing this square griddle pan.  I live alone and cook only for myself, so I don't need a lot of big pots -- just a few carefully chosen sizes to meet my everyday needs.<br /><br />This pan is perfect for pancakes.  I can mix up enough batter for 3-4 smallish pancakes, and cook them all on this pan.  Clean-up is a breeze as is the case with all of the Blue Diamond pans.  I don't have a dishwasher, so handwashing is my only option.<br /><br />I've been using this at least once or twice a week for the past year, and it's doing just fine -- still as non-stick as when it was new.

5,Works like it's supposed to ...,"I use sliced hard-boiled eggs on salads, and this slicer does a fine job slicing eggs of all sizes into perfect slices.<br /><br />It's sturdy enough but you need to treat it gently.

I've used it successfully for eggs, melon, strawberries, and boiled baby red potatoes.  No problems at all.",1677185201084,0,true

I need something useful that doesn't take up a huge amount of space.<br /><br />I saw this set, loved the colors, and knew of the brand's reputation.  So I splurged and purchased it as a holiday present for myself.<br /><br />Very happy with them!  They come with a small amount of salt and peppercorns as evidence that they were tested in the factory before shipment (some folks have complained that this shows they're ""used"" -- but it's part of the quality control at the manufacturer as explained in the accompanying literature).<br /><br />I have my sea salt in the salt grinder and my tellicherry peppercorns in the pepper grinder.  No complaints at all so far.  I use both of them daily and after almost 3 months of use, they're showing no signs of wear at all.<br /><br />Yes, they're pricier than other brands/models.

5,Didn't think I needed it until I got it ...,"I have an organization problem.  No matter what I try, I always seem to lose track of things, only to discover them weeks/months later.  This happens with small things mostly -- things that have a tendency to disappear behind other things.<br /><br />I use processed American cheese for grilled cheese sandwiches mostly -- it melts better than anything else and tastes great (I grew up on it, so ... ).  I especially like the individually wrapped variety as it stays fresher longer.  That is, until I lose track of the last few slices in a package and find it months later as part of an unintended science project in the back of the fridge.<br /><br />Enter this little box.  And that's all it is, really -- a cute box made to fit exactly the individually-wrapped slices of cheese.  I simply put the slices in the box, the box in the door of the fridge, and I know exactly where it is.  No more errant slices hiding in the far corners of the fridge.<br /><br />It's sturdy, well made, nice hinge, and a slight ""snap"" to the lid so it doesn't come open until I want it to.<br /><br />Just about perfect, really.

5,Everything I hoped for!,"I spent weeks scouring reviews to find the perfect bagged vacuum in my price range with the features I couldn't live without. Our house is mostly carpet and we have WAY too many animals. Our previous vacuum (Bissell Powergroom Bagless) was OKAY and appeared to pick up all the dirt/hair,  but the dust cup would come unsealed with the tiniest bump which let dust and hair into the filter to be spewed into the air. Our carpet shampooer would get clogged with all the pet hair the vacuum was leaving behind.<br /><br />So I tested this out today. I vacuumed one section of our home with our old vacuum before trying the new one. You would not believe how much hair and grossness the new vacuum picked up that was left behind.<br /><br />Then I tested another section by vacuuming with the new vacuum and following with the old vacuum. Not a single spec of dust or hair ended up in the old vacuums dust cup.<br /><br />The vacuum is much lighter, gets under more furniture, cleans closer to the walls. It has amazing suction on carpet and bare floors (even pine shavings and cat litter). It glides SO smoothly and the swivel head is absolutely wonderful. I'm in love.

It needs a boost button to adjust the highness of the Mist. Like a Low, Med & High Level. That's why I gave it a 4 Star rating. Overall you don't need to keep filling it up with water as often. It will go for 110 hrs before filling it up again. I like the Automatic Shut off when the Water Level gets to Low. Nice Product with no Leaks. Also, it doesn't take up much room at all.",1673140978052,1,true

4,"soft, smooth, lightweight, good color, good feel, hidden zipper, material is thin","Seems fine. Has super lightweight, smooth feel. Looks good, feels good, nice zipper, material could be thicker.<br /><br />Nearly all my pillow cases that I have purchased over the past 5 years that have zippers are these super petite zippers. They are used for ""hidden zippers"" which is what this uses. Basically, it is so much better for use on a pillow over a large chunky zipper with large dangly zipper pull. This is fine.  I have never had them fail, and I dont expect this one to. The material on this is quite thin though, and if anything I will be keeping my eye out for snags or rips. So far so good, but I am mildly wary.<br /><br />I bought this because it was cheaper than all others. $7.99 to cover a [[ASIN:B01FXROXFW body pillow]] that I purchased for a spare room. It wont be used but rarely, so I wasnt too concerned with quality, I guess. But I might opt for something more robust if I were using this daily and washing regularly.",1678799568622,0,true

Oh and a store brand. All are roughly (little less) 4.5"" x 5""<br /><br />This one is linen cotton with embroidery. I really like it. My other is [[ASIN:B0BQW9MB7D printed corduroy]], not problems with either in terms of fit or quality of stitching. Might be some variation, but I find these absolutely charming. Your experience may vary. I'd buy from this company again as I keep tissue boxes all throughout the house.",1678551021987,0,false
5,"soft & lofty, not firm. Nice to snuggle against","Soft, squishy, feels nice to curl up to. I accidentally learned that if I place it behind me when sitting on the couch, it will bend perfectly so I have an arm rest. I didnt know I needed that option in my life, haha.. but it was som comfortable to just snuggle into the pillow and kinda have it wrapped around me a little. I am plus sized, so all you more narrow folk will enjoy a bigger wrap. So now this is a couch pillow. Funny thing is that I just noticed someone asked that question in the community section. So yeh, I can confirm that it can do this. Though I had some of it held in place by sitting in corner of couch.<br /><br />I bought this because the other body pillow I have is a tad too thick and firm to comfortably sleep with. While I am a big person in all directions, I just found my pillow to be a tad too much.<br /><br />This is also a big pillow and side by side they nearly appear to be the same. But this has a little more softness. It can easily be folded in half. SO, I use my firmer one for use on a daybed (ok, really just a twin pushed up against a wall) where I wanted a good soilid pillow to add backing to sit up against. Then I use this one for when I am chilling out on the couch. I may buy another so I actually have one to keep on my bed to sleep with. I am a side sleeper and like having a pillow to drape my arm and leg over.<br /><br />5 stars because it suits what I am looking for and I have added another to my cart.",1678043712224,3,true
4,"stainless steel 6 pieces: butter knife, steak knife, sm/lg spoon, salad fork, dinner fork","Not matte, not exactly black. Very dark, shiny stainless steel material. ""stainless steel"" is stamped on each piece. Not too shabby a set for the price. I dont rate on price, but in this instance I think the price really factors into my decision to buy a second set. If it arrives with anything wrong about it, I will update this review.<br /><br />My 6 piece set came with:<br />-- steak knife (serrated)<br />--butter knife<br />--spoon, small (teaspoon?)<br />--spoon, large (dinner)<br />--fork, small (salad/dessert)<br />--fork, large (dinner size)<br /><br />Actually looks pretty good and feels good in hand. Not amazing, but much better than some $1 per utensil options out there.<br /><br />There was NO information that came with this, Just a baggy of silverware. Not a whole lot of infor needed. I just wasn't sure if these are dishwasher safe or not, but I went ahead and put them in the dishwasher because I really wouldn't want to bother with these if I had to always hand wash them. The product description says that they are dishwasher safe, and I can confirm that all pieces went through the dishwasher cycle just fine. Any spots buffed out easily.<br /><br />All pieces are good size, just sort of normal. The spoons aren't deep; they have a shallower cup--but still reasonable depth. Steak knife is basic. It's all kind of basic, and yet I like it. I dont need fancy silverware, I just needed to add a few basic peices to my scant silverware collection.",1677951519658,0,false
5,"fits over tissue box easily & securely, lovely maroon color w/ subtle rose print, looks good!","I like mine a lot. I ordered this because the coloring is on point to the decor of my living room. I have a lot of subdued colors, mostly maroon like this, with some simple paisley and small print floral. I always keep a box of [[ASIN:B00HX4FHDQ Genuine Joe tissue]] (or other brand) nearby, but have never found a cover I like. I tend to keep it in a large basket and try to ignore the bright colors.<br /><br />The soft cover fits my cube tissue box very well. Nice snug fit, and the stitching is pretty good. Looks even to me. Even enough. The texture is like corduroy (just like in pics) and the roses are subtle. Not a stand out design, which I really like. The coloring is perfect and as I hoped for.<br /><br />I'm pleased. Works for me.",1677948916060,0,false
4,"holds a lot, super easy to put together, not great at rolling, but great for storage","If this looks similar to others it is because they are all the same. I bought a couple [[ASIN:B09R1V45Y6 from another company]] and then this one. They are all the same. So my reviews are the same.<br /><br />It is extremely easy to put together. So easy, I didn't consult the instructions. The instructions are clear with a diagram if needed. The entire unit is lightweight, but it is sturdy and durable, holds a lot, and holds plenty of weight no problem. For the reviews that stays it falls apart, I imagine they didn't the pieces fit in snug enough. Make sure everything is pressed in as far as it can go, including handles. It is all pressure fit, no screws needed. Sits evenly.<br /><br />The wheels work fine on tile floor. I use this in my kitchen (and one in my office, and another in a food pantry room). I always seem to have a small pile of groceries sitting on the floor in one spot. Not wanting to keep that going, yet knowing I could use a little extra storage space, I got this cart to hold miscellaneous items. I keep bottles of water, cooking oils, breakfast items, some excess k-cups, and whatever else I need it to hold. I have no concerns with it collapsing. I think I could load it up with laundry detergent or gallons of water and it would be fine.<br /><br />Good size for my needs. I may consider another as I simply like it enough to want to use one elsewhere.<br /><br />The measurements are in the product pictures, and yes the height includes the wheels and handles. Take a close look. Not sure why there are questions and comments when the information is clearly in the description.<br /><br />I wouldn't pay more than the $23 I spent. If I were to spend more, then I would be looking into metal<br /><br />While you probably could use this with one less shelf, I wouldnt. You would be taking out one full support structure.<br /><br />Since mine is loaded up, it doesn't really roll. But I can scoot it across tile floor just fine. If truly needing a rolly cart, I'd go for metal or something more upscale.",1676838586627,2,true
5,"soft & cozy, smells clean direct from package, good fit, will be buying more","I bought this to use on my [[ASIN:B09MFCGN1F quilted full body pillow]] that doesn't need a cover, but I saw these fluffy soft sherpa covers and made an impulse purchase. My pillow measures 21"" x 54"" and this cover (21"" x 54"") fit with a little room to spare.<br /><br />I normally wash before use, but I was eager to put it on right away. Fits well, and mine does not have a chemical smell (can be normal). In fact it smelled pretty fresh.<br /><br />The material isn't real thick or of crazy good quality. But it works, and it is soft and cozy. I am giving it 5 stars because I am actually considering a different color, plus a pack of shams as well as euro cover.",1676836744536,0,true
5,"nice basket for anything, looks good, been buying this brand (and style) for about 10 years","I have several Spectrum Diversified (Scroll) products. Not purchased all at once. I have been adding to my collection over the past several years--dating back to 2014! All in perfect condition.  What I like is that they use a steel material and not a cheap wire. It makes all the difference in performance and overall look.<br /><br />I didnt have a direct need for this. I dont intend to place bread in it, ever. I do sometimes make use of a narrow long basket for apples or vegetables. I saw this listing and basically made the impulse purchase.<br /><br />I totally adore it. It does not work for a ""bunch"" of bananas, but it works nicely for my bag of vidalia onions that I dumped into this basket. I would use it for apples, peppers, potatoes, avocados, stuff like that. Or for snacks. I like that the bottom portion is caged so stuff doesn't fall out.<br /><br />I have their utensil holder, a tiered fruit basket, a large fruit bowl, a fruit basket with banana hanger, a paper towel holder, and now this ""bread"" basket. I dont use all the baskets at once, but will choose one or two based on my needs at the time.<br /><br />I am loving this basket. The material feels a tad thinner than other products, so I hope that isn't reflective of a quality change. Coating looks good, no chipping. So far still 5 stars. If I notice anything off or otherwise worth mentioning I will be back to do so.",1676133814168,1,true
3,"sturdy, easy to put together, bottom would benefit from actual tray rather than flat surface. Tall!","Read the product description! States in headline, description, and my order information that this is for nespresso compatible capsules (or pods, whatever you them) ONLY. I hoped there was a line of larger holes for k-cups since one of the pictures shows a brand and flavor that is only k-kup, but I figured it didnt since nothing else in the product description says otherwise. Since I use both, I am not entirely disappointed.<br /><br />What I am disappointed in is that it is kind of weird. If the bottom was a tray with shallow frame or walls rather than just being flat (see their pics. It wasnt entirely noticeable to me when I first ordered), I would have found more value in this. Items just sit like they do on the counter. I would rather have them be placed into a shallow walled tray so that way if I want to move it, items wont fall over.  Simple design fail that should be easy to fix on the manufacture part. OR you could flip it over yourself, but then the screw/securing holes dont line up. Without it being a real tray, this is rather useless.<br /><br />The unit once put together is sturdy. Not bad looking.<br /><br />The bamboo is scratched in a couple of places, but it is nothing I notice once put together. Only while constructing it was I looking at it up close enough to notice.<br /><br />HEIGHT! Take note of the dimensions as shown in tiny print in one of their pics. This stands just over 14"" tall. 14.17""  what an odd dimension. Had it been exactly 14"", this would have worked for me. But even if it fit, still need clearance for the capsules to be removed. Wouldnt be a problem to move it out from the space if the bottom ""tray"" was actually a tray.<br /><br />Alas, this is just a hair too tall for use in my kitchen under the cupboards. I will be donating this if I can't make it work somehow. Maybe use it to store paintbrushes or something that can benefit from the holes.<br /><br />Overall 3 stars. It is ok.<br /><br />I want to like it more, and I would if it actually fit under my cupboards and it had an actual tray rather than a flat surface for storing items. I love the idea of it, but it just doesnt quite measure up.",1675948886566,0,false

5,"nice look and feel, hangs well, wide grommet rings, linen-esque","I'm pleased. I wanted a natural plain curtain, and the linen-esque appearance drew my interest. I liked the subtle texture over totally smooth material. Grommet top with large grommet holes. I actually would have preferred a rod panel, but I could not find the equivalent in material, so I circled back to these grommet style panels. They work, I like them.<br /><br />I went with floor length (84"") and these fall perfectly into place. I bought 3 packs, so 6 panels all together, and they all appear to be even. Stitching looks good- simple but not cheap looking.<br /><br />Provides privacy yet lets in natural light. I really bought them mostly for looks. I have a wide picture window that I rarely close up. The other 2 sets (4 panels) are on a rod over a double sliding door that leads out into an unheated sunroom. We keep this door ajar all year long for our cats to be able to come and go from that window filled room, so I keep curtains up to help control heat loss (or heat coming in in summer). Ans yeh, maybe for a little added privacy.<br /><br />I appreciate the reasonable price. While I dont rate on price, I want to state that the price influenced my decision. I would have likely chosen something else had these not been $23.99 (with a coupon). Other colors are $10 more.  Not too shabby, but it definitely made me choose these ""natural"" color, over the ""light beige"" option. The natural color reminds me of inside of a 3musketeers candy bar. Like a nougat lool.<br /><br />I also appreciate that these are 52"" wide. That helped me decide how many panels I wanted to purchase.",1675268518955,5,true
5,clean tasting water for myself and my dogs,"I can taste difference between my tap water and this water. I bought this to use for my dogs water bowl. We have a water filter system as part of our fridge, but takes too long to get a few good size bowls of water changed out every day. Sometimes I would buy spring water, but that adds up. My other filter pitcher I gave away because it was old and I could not find the filters for it. So forward to me deciding to buy a new pitcher all together. I chose this based on reasonable price for the pitcher and future filters. I liked the size, the handle, and that it overall has good reviews. Now I can add mine to the mix.<br /><br />It filters quickly. I can keep some water in the top water reservoir and dont find that it spills out while pouring. I am just careful. I like that I can fill water bowls with ease. My dogs still love a good drink from the toilet, but they are perfectly happy with the water from this filter system. Side by side I think they like the gallons of spring water I was buying for them best, but isnt doable long term.<br /><br />Pitcher and handle feels durable.",1675097944493,10,true
5,"perfectly good hot pot of typical size and performance. Heats quickly, non stick, easy clean","Typical hot pot size. Has two heat settings, 200 watt and 600 watt. The latter will get your water boiling quickly.  Has lid with vent hole. Comes with an egg steamer tray (mine did anyway), which I have not used yet. It isnt mentioned as being part of the product, so I wont base any of my rating on it.<br /><br /> 3 prong cord, around 2 feet or so long. Non stick interior.  Very pale pink with a crystal like gem of a lid top. Not my personal choice, but also dont really care what color it is. Just love the functionality of a hot pot.<br /><br />I prefer my [[ASIN:B09V85M4FJ Stecoker hot pot with steamer basket]] but this one Denzin is perfectly fine. I find hotpots to add great value to my kitchen. I like not powering up the gas stove for smaller cooking needs. I often make a quick soup with left overs or a quick noodle bowl, and the size and capability of a hot pot is wonderful.<br /><br />This Denzin hotpot works fine and as expected.

5,"Wine tumbler?! For anyone, subtle color. Cap locks, skinny straw has good draw, well designed","A quality stainless steel travel bottle. It doesn't look or feel cheap. The petite size is perfect for kids, but also suitable for adults. I ordered this in green for me. It holds 14 ounces, and is expected to keep drink cold for 24 hours or drinks hot for 12. The typical time range for bottles like this.<br /><br />The feature I like best is that it locks (upped my 4 stars to 5 stars!). There is a tab that keeps the top from accidentally opening. To open, flick tab down then press button. Top pops up to expose a thin flexible straw. It has a good draw. No issues getting a mouthful of liquid. No brush cleaner, so hopefully you already own a skinny brush cleaner.<br /><br />There is an indicator on the bottle that changes color but I haven't paid any attention to that, and I dont recall what it means. See product pics for more info.<br /><br />Easy enough to unscrew the top and drink from the vessel directly. Nice for times I put coffee in this and dont want to draw from the straw.<br /><br />Optional carrying strap.<br /><br />If I drank more, I would definitely use this to store some wine. It is better than the insulated wine tumblers since it is truly leak proof.<br /><br />Would make for nice bedside water bottle.<br /><br />Green color is attractive and subtle. More of a pale celery green and has a classy look. Not childish.<br /><br />The bottle comes nicely packaged in a box with instructions and such. Just so you know, this is made in China and the info on box in in Chinese. That being said, I am quite pleased with this bottle.",1674833936352,1,false

All good!<br /><br />Bought a bunch of bags of this style for use in store and for general purpose around the house. They are just a versatile item to have on hand, and when not in use can be easily folded down to nothing. In fact, I like using them as little laundry baskets, or as ""toss all"" when cleaning up, as carrier when I am taking stuff from one end of house to another, for car organization, and for shopping. Also works in a pinch as a functional gift basket. Many times I have used a bag of this style for stuffing with gifts for someone.<br /><br />We have reusable shopping  bags, but sometimes I prefer the structure of the cube. More recently, a regional store chain got rid of all their shopping baskets because people were stealing them. While I normally use a cart, my husband is more apt to use a basket (or carry everything in one hand). I bought him [[ASIN:B07YXDKYZH larger VENO brand carry totes]] as well as this smaller size for use as a ""basket"" in store. He can then just bring it in, load it up, take it to counter, unload, then reload as items are scanned. Seems to be working out well for him. He tends to use the larger one, but these are good too.

4,"AMAZING COFFEE, carafe cracks/breaks easily","This coffee is PHENOMENAL! We are coffee people, (my boyfriend and in-laws are European coffee people), and everyone LOVES the coffee this machine makes! We've made coffee on all three settings and it's just lovely, for lack of a better word.<br /><br />It is also space-saving, and generally stunning to look at. (Even I was taken aback by the fact it is actually, downright sleek and pretty without being frilly.)<br /><br />That being said, it's a little high-maintenance, (though none of these things bother us):<br />• There is no clock, no timer, no automatic brewing, but not having that wiring and components inside is the reason it's so sleek looking.<br />• Also, it does brew very quickly, but you cannot pause or interrupt brewing, you need to wait until it's completely done to pour anything out of the carafe.<br />• There is a learning curve with removing the used grounds before pouring your first cup, but that's a really short learning curve.<br /><br />The thing that is actually getting to us is the carafe! It, to, is BEAUTIFUL, but it cracks with the slightest bump! The first time, it was knocked against the stone counter top, so we just ate it and bought a new one from the company's website ($28 + $11 shipping), kept a silicone trivet on the counter for when we need to set it down and we're otherwise very careful with it. The second time,  however, it seems to have just cracked. We were brewing coffee, noticed a pool of it forming below the carafe, and found a hairline crack in the bottom.<br /><br />I'm ordering ANOTHER carafe from the company's website and buying the 2 year protection plan, hopefully this time it goes better, because the coffee is truly so much better than a regular brewer.",1676211178528,1,true
5,Awesome chairs! Child and elderly friendly!,"I already had a set of these chairs from last year, so I knew these had the features I want already:<br />Comfortable, stylish, easy to clean/maintain (we have one set indoors and one set odors), difficult for little ones to damage, AND elderly friendly! (An accidental but fabulous discovery!)<br /><br />We have two elderly family members with different physical disabilities and these chairs are actually extremely helpful for them! The slight, curved decline in the seat helps an uncle with left-sided weakness [after a stroke] not slip forward in the chair and the ""wings"" on the back helps him keep upright, (he has some ability to stay upright, but does eventually start to lean left). The seat height, sturdy plastic, and side handles helps them both, (including my mother with horrific arthritis in her knees and shoulders), with getting into and out of the chair. I decided to switch out ALL of our dining chairs for these because I LOVE the look and LOVE that they make visiting just a little bit easier for our elderly family.<br /><br />Things to know:<br />1. If they are outside, tilt them forward when it rains, otherwise the pooling water will stain the seats. (Or just get the black ones for outside.)<br />2. If they do get a scratch or abrasion, some medium and fine grit sandpaper and hand sanding will get it right out.<br />3. The black is STUNNING and not overbearing. I wish I had an excuse to buy the black for my own home, but it doesn't match anything. I have seen it in a clients home and it is so beautiful! The other colors are simply lovely as well and NOT neon. (I have one set in white and one set in red).",1676041547501,1,true

1,"Sticky snow, not fluffy...","I really wanted to like this. I really want to let my children play with this. But unless I learn something new in the next few days, I can't let them play with this.<br /><br />THE BAD:<br />------------<br />* Not fluffy. More like sticky.<br />* Despite a product listing on Amazon that is full of words, there is no advice on ""how much"" water per packet. They simply say add water. Even on the packet, all it says is add water. So if getting fluffy snow depends on the right mixture of water and powder... then good luck! It's trial and error.<br /><br />DAY 2 UPDATE:<br />-------------------<br />* So, just as suspected, this won't feel like snow at all. Today, we purposely pour very little water to a packet and watch it fluff up. We continued to add water little by little, hoping there will be a stage where the snow will be both fluffy and sticky. Unfortunately, there is no such stage. Once there is enough water to make it sticky, the fluffiness is gone. So here are your options:<br /><br />* Option 1: Less water equals fluffy snow, but you can't make a snowman or anything. It's just flaky or powdery, it does not take any form.<br />* Option 2: Keep adding water till it gets sticky. At this point, the fluffiness is gone. You'll be playing with clumpy goo, and your hands will always have gooey ""snow"" sticking to it. Real snow will flake off your hands clean. Not this gooey snow.<br /><br />Lastly, it says this ""snow"" will dry out and return to powder form, and will be reusable. It's been several days, and my bucket of goo hasn't changed one bit. I think you would need to wait for eternity for it to return to powder form.<br /><br />1-Star.",1676869459488,0,false

4,3 Speeds plus more cooling options…,"[[VIDEOID:e1b4364569430624185357180737fc58]] Average fan to circulate air with the added cooling benefit.  The motor is pretty quiet so that even on high it won’t interfere with a TV.  The oscillating works great too for extra room coverage.  I wish the whole display would light up for nighttime use.  And I wish that the base wasn’t wobbly.  Other than those two things, it works good.<br /><br />Trust you found this review honest and helpful:-)",1677123319617,0,false

5,Great price for what you get,"This is an incredible card storage option. I have for years wanted the one by BCW, who was really the only people who made these. Never got theirs because it's been out of stock every time I go to look at it for over five years now. This one was in stock, and much cheaper. The quality is great too. I very highly recommend.<br /><br />But there is room for improvement. The outer box the little boxes go in is a bit too wide. You can see in one of their pics, they have wedged cardboard pieces in the sides, to make it look better. You won't get those, so don't expect that. Still though, for the savings, I'm fine with it, but I do hope they get the measurements down a little better one day.<br /><br />The smaller boxes have been great, no complaints at all. I will get more of these as needed.",1678490238402,0,false

4,Nice bag for dvds,"This dvd storage bag is awesome! It holds a ton of dvds and protects them from dust and moisture. The bag is also transparent so you can easily see what's inside. It has nylon carry handles that work well but the bag is vinyl so if you have it loaded to the brim with dvds- I recommend treating it like a paper grocery store bag and use the handles to lift it but then put a hand underneath it to carry it. I'm positive in time the vinyl will rip if you don't take care of it like this. Doesn't mean you shouldn't get it, just know if it's packed full then you'll wanna handle with caution to prolong it's use. I've had vinyl bags before and pro tip- you can use clear tape or duck tape and patch any holes they get along the way, makes em last forever!",1678465655682,0,false
5,Super easy to install/use and the installation is quick and painless,"This was super easy to install and get going. I used a couple other thermometors to compare to this one and see if it's accurate and this actually is pretty accurate! I love that it has different colors on it like green for if you're using an acceptable temp or red if you're using a temp too hot that could cause burns. Overall very happy with this, it works great!",1678418987600,0,false
5,Absolutely stunning and very mid century looking,"I'm a mid century fanatic and this white with the gold center piece absolutely fits in with my decor! The bowl is about the size of a little rice bowl- not overly big and obnoxious- has a smaller footprint but is plenty heavy so it won't tip over from a large incense stick.<br /><br />It comes with rubber feet you can stick on the bottom if you want to keep it from easily sliding around. The gold piece in the center is loose so if you use a larger incense stick or multiple sticks at once, you'll have to watch out as the center piece tries flopping over. You can easily glue it in place or even use some of that sticky poster gum that you hang posters with. Hot glue would be a great option as you can pull it back up easily if you needed to.<br /><br />Overall this is a beautiful incense holder and it's working out great for me! No more putting incense on the edge of furniture and having to sweep up the pieces later!",1678242342556,0,false
5,"Great print job, absolutely beautiful!","I'm not a woman but I found this so beautiful that I had to have it! The print job on it is fantastic, very good quality print!!

5,"Really good quality, great value!! Fits my king bed perfectly and not too tight.","This fit on my king bed perfectly and I didn't have to fight it to get on there which was very nice. The edges of it are a thinner stretchy material and it makes it so easy to work with! Quality wise- it looks well made and I think it's definitely worth the asking price! Will update this review in the long term if any issues arise after washing or whatever but as of now, I'm thrilled with it!<br /><br />As far as using it to pad your bed, it's not paper thin but it's not super fluffy. If your bed is uncomfortable, has even a tiny noticeable sag, or is a few years old, these mattress pads will never be the solution. I replaced my bed that had a TINY sag to it and my back pain vanished with my new memory foam hybrid bed. Just saying, I've tried every topper and pad on the market, they won't help with mattress sag, nothing will. But if you're just looking to protect your mattress a bit and add a little more cushion to it, this will work for that.",1676666069155,0,false
4,"Interesting concept I was unsure of but this pillow is fluffy, soft, and amazing!","I needed a new pillow. I'm a restless person who tosses and turns during the night and I was in search of a pillow that was comfortable and also helped with my sleeping problems. The pillow has helped me so much and I'm so happy with the results. It is very comfortable and has helped me sleep better. There is nothing better than waking up feeling rested and refreshed!<br /><br />It arrives in a vaccuum sealed bag with the air sucked out so once you open that bag and pull the pillow out, it'll fully fluff up in a few short hours. So open it up the moment you get it if you plan on using it that day. It'll be a pancake when you open it and you'll think it's gonna be a slim pillow but within hours it poofs up all by itself and is plenty thick! I love the shreds because I can move them around a bit to conform to how I want it to be.<br /><br />**If you're sensitive to VOCs from things like memory foam- put this in a garage or something and unzip both zippers/ let it air out for a week. I had to air mine out because the smell instantly gave me a headache when I laid down on this pillow. After it's aired out though, it's amazing!",1676354994591,1,false
5,"Really good budget table, love it! Full assembly required FYI.","I love this coffee table because it has a hidden compartment that can hold all of my remotes, books, magazines, and anything else I need to store. It's also super easy to keep clean and the lift top makes it easy to put in or take out anything. It's a great addition to my home.<br /><br />**Assembly was easy enough and didn't take me long at all. I was able to assemble it easily with just myself. The final product is a decently stable coffee table! Obviously it's not solid wood so don't get this thinking you're gonna be sitting or standing on it- that'll absolutely break it quick! Other than that it's great though!",1676354697496,0,false
5,"VERY impressed with the quality of this, best hamper I've had!","I've grown tired of replacing the cheapo netted laundry bags that rip and need replacing quickly. I hate big plastic bulky things... So this one that can fold up and fit into smaller spaces is just perfect! I was blown away when it came though, it's very thick fabric, very nice looking, no flaws to be seen in it's craftsmanship! And it holds a LOT of laundry.<br /><br />The one thing that should be noted is it has no frame... It stands on it's own ok but if you stand it up empty in the middle of the floor, you will just have to open it up a bit like you would a paper bag. I guess that's the best comparison of this thing- it's just like a big paper bag as far as how much support the body has. Not a deal breaker for me as it's so durable and has really nice durable handles too but it seems that some people might want something with more of a frame.",1676350625170,0,false
3,"Cheap wood, cheap finish, easy to assemble","I assembled this in like a minute without instructions. The wood is lightweight and cheap looking due to the finish they put on it. They put a black stain on it and it looks like someone colored wood with a black marker- just doesn't look too amazing. The gold metal is sturdy enough and looks nice. My metal parts came slightly bent- I recommend you checking these over very closely to see that they're both not bent on all the 4 sides that attach to the wood. I went to attach the last two sides and realized they were a little off so thought I'd bend them with screws in them- ripped them straight out of the wood and damaged it a lot since the wood is so cheap... SO lesson learned, bend before screwing it in place! It was so bent that it wouldn't screw all the way in was why I had to mess with it. I unscrewed it though, bent it a bit, and was able to get it to take the screws back for the most part. It's kinda wonky in one place but holding for now. If you do this and have the same issue, you could possible break parts of a toothpick off and cram them in the screw hole. Then you put the screw into that and it'll help hold it into place.<br /><br />Overall for the price point, it's not terrible and doesn't look hideous on the wall. Just think it's worth about half the price though. Although with the cost of everything including lumber today, maybe the price point is fair enough.",1676175535495,0,false
5,"Good sized pot holders, love them!","I have some similar to this style but they're much shorter- these are actually pretty decent sized and kind of longer than the standard square pot holders. They're plenty thick and provide protection for your hands if you use them as an oven mit, they work great for protecting your counters, and we've used them for putting under our soup bowls full of hot liquid so we can take our bowls to eat in front of the tv and they won't burn our hands as we're eating or waiting for it to cool a bit.<br /><br />Colors are vivid on these and quality seems pretty good. They don't look like something expensive or fancy but they do the job so I'm happy with them.",1675637983981,0,false
5,The nostalgia!! Reminds me of Pizza Hut in the 90s!,Our city's old Pizza Hut had these back in the 90s and I love how big they were!! It's absolute nostalgia seeing them again and I'm happy to have them! They're so large that they're great for coke floats too- PLENTY of space for ice cream and soda in the cup! These huge cups are sturdy and the coke logos on them look good. I'm in love with them!,1674453989547,0,false
5,Good quality set of towels,"These are really good quality towels, was very impressed with them! I've gotten some complete garbage towels in the past but these are good quality and they're not falling apart right out of the package like the cheapos do. No crazy chemical smells either which is nice. Medium softness to them and they get softer after the first wash and dry. Good product!",1674453371386,0,false
3,Could have been better,"Not good, not bad either though. It's easy enough to set up and understand. At first I loved all the different options to change the thickness of the slices, and how many strips the slices get cut into. But the little blades that cut the food into strips don't go all the way down. So if you don't want strips, you'll have slices with lots of cuts all over them, which look ugly.<br /><br />What I really hate though, is that it crams the food through the back of it, and it gets a bunch stuck in places you can't get to, not matter how hard I try, I can't get all the food out. Food doesn't go in the bowl underneath it, and it mashes a lot of the foods instead of cutting. You also have to cut the food up to fit in the chute, and after I've cut it up with a knife, why do I need a mandoline? I'll just keep cutting it with a knife...<br /><br />I love that it's safer, as I have hurt myself on my old mandoline before. I like that it folds, but this just isn't a good value. You can get a good mandoline for cheap, so this is not something I'd recommend to anyone I personally know.",1674107200753,1,false
5,Easy one person assembly and results in a sturdy classy looking chair!,"This was easy to put together for me and I hate putting things together. I think I only had to glance at the instructions a couple of times was all but it was easy to put it together and the final result is a classy looking sturdy chair! It looks like something you'd buy in a fancy furniture store so the price point isn't bad considering that. The wood is good quality and it's a decently weighted stool, not lightweight particle board junk you'd find at Wal mart.<br /><br />I definitely will be buying a couple more of these so I have a nice set of them for my bar.",1674078917412,0,false
5,"Good quality bowls, it comes with 2 sets of bowls (4 total pieces)","These are very sturdy feeling bowls and the strainers easily attach to the bowl and are easily able to be removed. The bowls under them can even double as mixer bowls for baking stuff which is nice.<br /><br />I made pasta and poured it into one of these and love how easy it is to use! Very simple but well-made functional little bowls. They're smaller to mid size, not large so if you need a larger one then this isn't it. They're smaller than a full-size colander bowl.",1674077214519,0,false
1,"The plunger is unusable, it goes in and doesn't pop back out","Tried using the plunger multiple times and you push it in but it doesn't spring back out. I put it on inside wall of the toilet and tried flexing the rubber end piece until it flopped back up into it's normal shape but it just doesn't do it. It's been sitting for a day now bent inwards and isn't popping back out. It's unusable and did nothing to plunge my toilet sadly.<br /><br />The handles for the toilet scrubber and the plunger each have two pieces that screw together, then you screw that onto the plunger and the scrubber piece. Not crazy about that as it's just another crevice for gunk to build up and makes it harder to clean.<br /><br />The scrubber itself is decent enough, it does the job. It's very rough though, I'd only recommend it for older toilets that get buildup in the bottom or ones where you get a lot of hardwater buildup. For newer toilets, it'll scratch the porcelain in time and then cause buildup to happen and it's nearly impossible to clean. I highly recommend a silicone toilet brush to clean your toilet, it's much gentler. That being said, this brush does do what it's supposed to so I don't take away any stars for any of this. I gave it a one star because the star of the show (the plunger) is worthless sadly.<br /><br />The little base it sits in is pretty lightweight but looks nice and I like that they put drain holes where the toilet brush goes so water doesn't buildup there under the brush. Now when water gets in where the plunger is- you can just pick the whole thing up and tilt it over the toilet to drain the excess water.<br /><br />Overall this was a good but poorly executed idea- the toilet handles should all be one piece and the even bigger problem is whatever junk rubber they used on the plunger isn't working out. Throwing it in the trash sadly.",1674073200587,0,false
4,"Cheap craftsmanship, handles look cheap, could have done a lot better","This would look better with some more decorative handles on it but it comes with them not attached so you can always leave them off or replace them with something else. I intend on getting some silver bat handles and putting those on there in place of the ones included.<br /><br />The tray itself is mediocre quality, the finish isn't flawless and has spots where it doesn't fully cover the wood. You have to really be looking at it to notice these things though and I say it's still worth the asking price if you're not planning on making one yourself from scratch.",1673473011384,0,false
2,Lumpy and pretty clear when you look at it from one side,"I don't know if you are supposed to be able to see thru selenite like glass but on one side of this, I can see into it perfectly like it was just a glass ball. The ball is lumpy and not smooth at all, looks a bit goofy when you are holding it and looking at it.<br /><br />The base is kinda cheap looking and they put some ugly red felt on top so when the crystal is on top of the base, the red shows up clear at the top of the crystal and looks goofy. So i'll definitely be changing the fabric out under the crystal to something white.<br /><br />Bottom line for me? Not worth $26 at all! This ball should be more like $10 for how goofy it and the stand looks.",1673472800843,0,false
4,"Nice little drain cover, surface has to be pretty much perfectly smooth","My bathtub isn't perfectly smooth around the overflow drain that you put this over (the old bathtub's finish is etched from people using harsh chemicals to clean it.) So this doesn't stay on there very well sadly. I did test it out on surfaces like a mirror and it sticks to those pretty well but not on my gritty bathtub sadly. I did take it to a friend's house when visiting and used it in his acrylic tub and it works perfectly fine in there! The suction isn't that strong on these but for what it is, it doesn't really have to be that strong.<br /><br />Overall it's a cheap little thing and it feels pretty flimsy but for the price- I think it's worth it for getting a few more inches of water!",1673471862137,0,false
4,"Pretty and vibrant colors, wish it was a little longer and wider though","This is a pretty nice hat and the colors are very vibrant! It seems well enough made and looks great! My only complaints are that it's a bit of a snug fit on my head and in typical Santa hat fashion, there's no elastic on the head band so there's really no give if it doesn't fit right. I also feel like it'd look better if it was slightly longer but that's just a personal preference. Overally this is a super cute hat and I definitely look forward to wearing it next Christmas!",1673471673647,0,false

5,Great Shower Curtain - does not blow inward,"I have been searching for a shower curtain that does not blow inward. I was unsuccessful until now! This shower curtain is heavy duty and does not blow inward. I am using this as a liner, but could be used on its own as well.",1678462973042,1,true
3,Disappointing,"The cutting board and knife are nice, heavy, good quality. That's where it ends. The box itself looks nice besides the small damage in 2 places but it is low quality. Cheaply made. I don't know what I imagined when I compared bread boxes for a month and landed on this one but my dreams and reality were continentally divided. Before leaving less than 5 stars I like to recheck the ad, the seller is upfront and the dimensions and photos are there so this one is on me, thus 3 stars for not scamming but I would not pay $50 for this, think $25 at big lots or something. It feels like it could fall apart when I open the doors which have already gave me trouble closing properly on day 1. The shelf inside just sits on those little metal pegs and is wobbly if you touch it. The glass doors have plastic which is tucked into the seams and harder than normal to remove. Item came packaged nicely and was easy to assemble. It arrived late by 3 days, thanks Amazon. It is much smaller than I pictured too, my kitchen aid mixer dwarfs it. I may return this and purchase something that will actually hold up to a loaf of bread",1674058246635,3,true

5,Durable but a little smaller than hoped,"This is easy to clean and store and so far has worked well for us. That being said, it is a bit small for our air fryer.

5,An ingenious design,"This little manual chopper is cleverly designed. It needs no batteries or electricity. The sharp chopping blades are powered by a pull string. It's great for garlic, onions, and herbs. (For more heavy-duty jobs, I'd stick to a food processor.)<br /><br />It's small and super-easy to clean. With only three pieces, it's a cinch to take apart and put back together.  Swish it in soapy water, rinse, and let dry. You don't have to touch the blades, and I don't recommend it. (Kinda goes without saying. )<br /><br />If you use a lot of onions, garlic, and garden herbs in your cooking, this could be your new best friend. I just got it, so I'm not sure how long the pull-string thing will last. It's like those toys you had when you were a kid. It could last forever, or not...It probably depends on how you use it.",1678721826341,0,false
5,Cheerful and Practical,"These cheery silicone trivets will protect countertops and tables from hot serving dishes. A perfectly-sized hole in each makes them easy to keep handy. If you prefer drawer storage, they are flatter and more flexible than conventional trivets so they take up less space without sacrificing effectiveness. If something spills, no worries. They are easy to clean. You can even put them in the dishwasher. Nice! As suggested in the product description, they would make a much-appreciated housewarming gift.",1678720362478,0,false
5,Easy ice for waterbottles,"These pretty, reusable ice tubes make cold water, drinks, or smoothies easy. They are designed to drop right into a water bottle and there are six of them, so you can always have a few in the freezer. Speaking of freezers, ours can sometimes, uh, pick up odors, ruining conventional ice. Just keep these little tubes in a plastic or resealable silicone bag. Problem solved. No more off-tastes. That makes them good for drinks in glasses as well as water bottles. Another bonus--there's always room for them, even in the most crowded freezer. A very clever idea.",1678719875408,0,false

4,Cheaply Made but Works Well,"I am fairly impressed with this heated lunch box. First, it is cheaply made, that's obvious by how easily the snaps on the sides and front, and back come off with no problems at all. This can cause the seal to be broken on the lunch box can cause a leak, so be careful about that. Also, the lunch box is just a small thin piece of plastic with a warming mechanism under a metal plate at the bottom. It does warm up pretty nicely and it only gets so hot but the longer you leave the food inside the box it does get hotter and stays hot for a while. While it is cheaply made it does work pretty well and I am happy with it. Hopefully, it will last a while and I will get a lot of use out of it.",1673742346218,0,false

5,"Quiet, functional, elegant.","[[VIDEOID:906e15798de7c6cc0f9c764a866503cd]] I've been building up my smart home system over the last couple of years and as much as possible, I tried to keep the cost down.  In my product choices, I also try to keep things local.  If I can avoid having a product to go the cloud, I'll do it.  With that said, I've been reluctant to spend the money on motorized blinds because they are just really expensive.  My experience with the Astomi Smart Blinds is that sometimes, you need to bite the bullet and spend that money because sometimes, you get what you pay for.<br /><br />A couple of things factored into my decision to take the plunge.  First is that the Astomi has zigbee support which would fit my requirement that my home automation devices stay local and second, I found that due to the placement of a large desk in front of my old blinds, my kids had a hard time opening them and would usually turn on the lights rather than take advantage of the bright sun that's outside.  I've always tried to encourage them to allow as much sunlight in as possible.  With motorized blinds, they can not only open the blinds more easily, I can actually program them to open during the day and close at night.<br /><br />I customized my Astomi Smart Blinds during the ordering and they arrived after about 2 weeks.<br /> Installation was straightforward and the motor stopping points were preprogrammed to the correct length.  All I needed to do after installation was charge the curtain rod and control it via the remote control.<br /><br />The next step was to connect the blinds to my home automation system.  While I did order the zigbee hub with the blinds just in case the Astomi had some non-standard zigbee protocol like Aqara products, I'm happy to report that these blinds connected to my Home Assistant system through zigbee2mqtt and all functionality was automatically recognized.<br /><br />It was then a simple addition to my dashboard and configuration to have full voice and app control over the blinds.<br /><br />I love this thing!  I have it open 30 minutes after sunrise and 40 minutes before sunset.",1672941529339,0,true

4,Very Useful,"I am using this on one of the tables in my art studio to organize various loose items.  It was pretty easy to put together, except for the clips that hold the wire baskets together. They require quite a bit of strength or a pair of pliers to engage.  The baskets slide in and out pretty well and they hold a lot depending on what you are doing. I was able to put another kind of organizer inside one and still had room at the end for other compartments to hold scissors, etc.",1676829210409,0,false

So you can "" warm it up"" you can only place the mug on it cold.  So then the coffee looses heat because its sitting there while the warmer warms up.  No switch is available.

5,Fun and functional,"These worked perfectly, looked nice, and the remote was really helpful so you don’t have to so any contortions to get your lights on and off. I used them on my mantle and on the Christmas tree. I waited until after the holidays to report on their reliability and I can say they ran 24/7 for weeks with no trouble. I look forward to using them in the years to come. Great value.",1677496808344,0,true
3,Are these tools for ants?,"These are so tiny. They were purchased for an office party with a gold theme so they worked for that and looked nice.  However, in addition to the small size making them awkward to pinch, they still allowed everyone’s hands to get too close to the food. People choked up on them because it made them easier to control so their booger pickers were getting dangerously close to touching things. Maybe I’m a size queen but 6” is definitely not enough.<br /><br />On the plus side, the color is nice and the finish seems to be durable. I’ve only hand-washed them but they are holding up to that.",1677495619356,0,true

The handles are reinforced so even when completely filled up, I’m never worried about ripping, tearing or breaking. The insides line so you can easily wipe it clean.

After using, you can disassemble everything and store compactly till the next time you need it. It’s tall enough that you can hang very long pasta. I used every square inch and it held the weight perfectly.",1678648091579,0,false

5,Unique solution!,"I am so happy with these! They are wood and real glass and are nice quality. The hinges work without bending or squeaking. The magnets that hold the display top to the base are strong. Inside, you can use the elastic straps to hold your art to the base. You don’t have to though, you could tape or pin if you didn’t want to see the elastic. The back has mounting options vertically and horizontally. The option to change out my kids’ art is so much fun! I wish I’d had these years ago.",1678008678136,0,false
4,Useful!,"What a nifty little hat holder. This was really easy to assemble. The two brackets fit underneath the band of wood, and you simply screw the brackets to the wall. It comes with all the hardware, it comes with really cheap wall anchors, so if you’re going to use wall anchors, I suggest you use your own. I took a star off because it has this dorky logo on the wood that says cowboy. Any real cowboy does not need to advertise the fact that he’s a cowboy. And it would be the one thing that would make my husband say to take these things down. But they’re very handy and they do a fantastic job of safely storing hats.",1677851352332,0,false
5,Fantastic accessory holder!,"I’m using this in my armoire to hold belts, scarves, and other miscellaneous items that seem to get lost. There are metal brackets or hangers that lupine from the top.

There are four pockets across and three pockets down and they’re all slanted and deep so they hold things without fear falling out. I love this it helps me stay organized.

Highlighted on a bookcase next to a cognac couch. looks super hot. 🔥 It’s so pretty, I would totally re-order this and highly recommend it.",1677153564450,0,false
5,Cool concept,"This is a thin, lighter weight cast-iron disc on 1/4 inch feet that have a plastic pad on them. It does a good job as a trivet, but probably because it’s elevated. It’s very unique, and if there is a cast iron lover in your life this would make a neat gift.",1677153360108,0,false
3,Challenging instructions; clunky interface,"I wish these kind of lights were programmed to do just one thing. Wake me up like the sunrise. Maybe have a sunset setting tho I’m rarely in my room at the same time each night. Instead, there’s all sorts of bells and whistles and the manual/instructions are somewhat lost in translation. To use this you MUST DOWNLOAD AN APP!!  Set up occurs there and it’s very unclear as to am/pm settings. The only light I could get to be steady is white. Bright white at that. All other light choices automatically switch between colors. So, if you want ambient orange light to be steady, you’re outta luck as far as I can tell. This light could be much much better. Setting it up will hijack a good 2 hours of your time and you’ll be so peeved, you may just up and forget it.",1676818408763,0,false
4,Nice and solid.,I like everything about this curtain rod other than the hardware. I ended up using my own. It’s well made and not flimsy at all.

5,Absolutely stunning!,"What a gorgeous set of flatware. I audibly gasped when I opened the box. This is a 75 piece set that is service for 12. It includes a serving fork, a serving spoon and a slotted serving spoon. It is 18/10 stainless steel, in the world flatware that’s the strongest stainless. Each piece has excellent balance and weight to it, and feels sturdy in your hand without feeling clunky. The steak knives are serrated and have a very sharp tip and cut meat well. The hammered finish makes each piece shimmer! Looks amazing in low/candle light. I am very happy and I highly recommend.",1676468907440,0,false
5,Functional; unique,"Every single time I use this somebody comments on it. The color is absolutely gorgeous and I want to re-decorate my kitchen using this periwinkle. Lol. The shape of the lid allows easy access to the handles when baking, and then, obviously you use it as a trivet when serving. It’s very sick it’s heavier than you expect. Therefore conducting heat evenly and making everything inside of it perfectly.  🫶🏼",1676126388848,0,false
5,Such a space saver,This is such a clever design. It took me less than five minutes to assemble and about five minutes to install. It’s very easy. The paint is a flat mat so it’s very subtle and not obnoxious in your bathroom. It holds eight pretty fluffy towels. and has allowed us an entire extra cabinet now bathroom space since we move the towels to the wall,1676126206442,1,false
4,Decent,"This took me about 15 minutes to assemble from start to finish. The directions are pretty easy to understand. I wish it were just slightly more sturdy feeling. And when you sit on the cushion, it has a crinkly sound, and is very firm and stiff. Overall, it will work for what I need it to do. It’s not a showstopper, but if you need a piece in an empty corner for a reasonable price, this is a pretty good deal.",1675986565375,1,false
4,Decent,"Sometimes you just have to have fake plants. I have two kittens, who demolish every single live plant that I own. I’ve had to put them all out of reach. In the meantime, I’d like to have some greenery around the house, and this bamboo fit the bill. This contains four real stalks of bamboo that are dried. With the fake branches shoved inside the top, and also placed in pre-drilled holes throughout the stalks. It looks fake, but I don’t care. The base is very sturdy.",1675986405697,0,false
4,Quite decent!,"I love the look of this artificial cedar. The base is heavy and sturdy. However, unpacking the base is a total nightmare. It’s wrapped up in ninja tape so just be mentally prepared and maybe have an X-Acto knife. I took off a star because the leaves are attached to the base in a way that  if you simple tug them they pull right off. It’s not ideal because if you have to move the plants from place to place all the needles just slip right off. It takes some time to have to go back and push them back on.",1675986238246,0,false
3,Flimsy,"This is just a so-so press. The metal top does not fit snug in the glass insert, the metal band on the bottom is ultra thin and bent upon 1st use. Because this is a 3 piece unit, the entire thing needs to be disassembled after every use or water will accumulate and get stuck between the glass and the base. I wouldn’t order this again.",1675868924583,0,false
5,Feels like Grandma’s,This has a starchy feel and a real embroidered look.  The roses are delicate and the trim work is actually quite pretty. Looks like something in my Grandma’s house and has a vintage vibe.,1675623443004,0,false
5,Perfect!,This is a beautiful carafe. It looks vintage. The glass is a faint blueish green. Hand wash only. And is thin and delicate. This is such a fantastic solution to keep water by your bed if you have a cat. Makes me feel super fancy.,1675606583819,0,false
4,Mid-tier salad plate,"The rim of these is textured but there is ample room for salad, or appetizer. The back is plain, no writing. Medium weight, medium thinness.

Used my second one for a decade before I replaced it (it still works it’s just discolored) used my 3rd on for years before moving it to our rental, where it’s used it several times a week. And currently enjoying this stainless steel version. Easy to use. Clean to use. Takes up a small amount of space. The best by far!",1675251241762,0,false
5,Lifetime purchase!,What a gorgeous pan. Clean lines and visually pleasing. The interior has grid marks on it. At first I was skeptical but I cooked both scrambled eggs and a chop in it and was very happy with results. The skillet is roomy and is a tri-ply clad so there is even heat distribution; No hot spots. The handle is reinforced with stainless rivets; No loose or wobbly handles. And it’s long enough to stay cool to the touch when on stove top.,1675172148028,0,false
5,Massive! Leakproof!,"This thing is seriously big. But I absolutely love it. The bottom has a removable plastic base that makes it absolutely skid proof. You can even use it as a little doggy water bowl if you need to. The outside coating has a slight amount of texture to it, making it grippable and not slippery. The  widemouth lid screws on and the pour spout also screws on to form a complete seal. There is  a handle to carry it with too. This is how much water should we should be drinking every single day so even if you use this to pour your water into a smaller cup, it’s a great tool to use  to ensure you’re hydrated",1674482441988,0,false
5,Fun to use; excellent espresso!,"This is a little jam of an espresso machine. The color is adorable and looks modern and unique. I like the fact that it’s not a huge machine. Therefore, it doesn’t take up too much countertop space. Though it’s compact, it still makes gorgeous espresso. The steamer wand is easy to use and cleans up to a like new condition. This machine is not shipped with a metal frothing pitcher. You have to provide your own. Overall, I am very pleased with this. I would totally order it again.",1674482139010,0,false

4,Easy to assemble/mount,"This cabinet measures 23 x 23 and is made out of wood press board. It’s pretty cheap material, and the backing is like heavy vinyl. The simple design in the classic shaker cabinet make it look a little classier. I’m a 50 year old woman and assembled this in about 40 minutes, and hung it in about 15. You’ll need a screwdriver, a level, and a drill. If you don’t mount it directly to a stud, you’re going to need wall anchors also. Overall, I’m happy with a look, and I cannot believe how much this cabinet holds. I really like the open cubby below for often needed items.",1674157341189,0,false

There are 12 holes on the top for shower rings and it’s a standard length to fit a standard shower. The white has a cream undertone. With six sets of skinny taupe stripes running horizontally. Very well-made I would totally order this again.",1674156476369,0,false
5,Massive,"Make sure to measure your basket before you buy these because they are definitely on the bigger side. I should’ve read it however, it’s not gonna influence my review of the product because that’s my fault for not reading description. This parchment is really thick and it has good crimped edges, so it totally fits into a square size air fryer. So far I haven’t seen any scorching or burning on the paper. I love using parchment I think it just keeps your air fryer so much cleaner. It’s so easy to handle the food that way also. I would totally order this product again.",1673642392905,0,false
5,Handy contraption,These are actually pretty useful. Traveling with cakes/cupcakes is  always a pain because you’re worried that they will get smooshed. This comes with 24 thick plastic trays.

I’m not going to because it doesn’t bother me. Overall totally gorgeous , highly recommend.",1673459010412,0,false
5,These are perfect,"These are great little scoops. This comes with 10 pieces all together five different colors two of each color.

4,Extremely thin/delicate,"This is a cute set of espresso cups. They are much thinner and much lighter than I expected. One of them was cracked upon receiving.

4,Takes practice,"This is definitely more for show on a counter than practical use in real life. I had friends over for dinner and they all jokingly tried to figure this out. None of them instinctively knew how it worked. The wine bottle hangs a little lower than you’d think.  Only a full size wine bottle will weigh enough to balance, champagne neck and cork are too wide to fit in hole. Marble is excellent quality.",1673269203266,0,false
5,Pretty!,I got this in gold and it’s actually really pretty. It’s solid ceramic with a shiny painted/glaze finish. There is some texture to the piece also. It fits a wide variety of spoons/ladles.

5,Best value for $$!,"I’m pretty shocked that this rug is as well-made as it is and that you can get it for the price offered. It’s not thick so if you want to plush it out a bit you’ll need a rug pad. But it’s very soft and it cleans up marvelously. I’m using it in front of my kitchen sink, where I seem to absolutely thrash any rug. This one’s held up very nice.",1672937039824,2,false
5,Perfect!,It’s a very cool garlic holder. The entire base is ceramic and there are vents at the bottom. The cork top is very lightweight and concave to hold extra shallots or whatnot. The white finish is matte and not shiny. It looks very contemporary and is very well-made.,1672933396614,0,false

2,great but not very sturdy,"I like these, but they get very hot so you have to use hot pads to take them out of the air fryer. Cleans great in dishwasher. food doesn't burn easily at all.

I added a little cinnamon to them and they were perfect. They were crunchy and chewy at the same time. This is perfect for my vegan diet. I also love the fact that I don’t have to use all the trees and stack it how high I want. I will recommend this to family and friends. It’s so worth it.,1672960110981,0,true

4,It's decent.,"I want to love this chair, and there's so many positive things about it. The mesh is great and a welcome material over the old faux leather style office chair I'm replacing it with. The mesh is breathable and bends just enough to support with comfort. However, the shape of the back is kind of ...odd. It looks cool and futuristic but I wish it could be adjusted for better comfort. It's ok if you lean forward while you work a lot like I do, but if you find yourself leaning back a lot, I probably wouldn't like it as much. I do like that it is fairly light weight and doesn't sit so high as to take over a smaller room. I do really like the mesh material, it's worth checking out in my opinion.",1678842648717,0,false
5,Can't have enough of these,"I love this style of organization for my home. From the playroom to my home office, they are great for organizing stuff in a way that is still easy to rummage through and find. And in the case of toys, dump out onto the floor (which is a mixed blessing depending on your perspective!).<br />These are pretty standard issue for the style, they are not the sturdiest but they are on par with discount store brands. I'm using them to store USB cables and chargers in my home office and it is just right for that.",1678740960855,0,false
5,Cool styling + Charging ports,"This is an excellent side table for our guest room. I wanted something to separate the bed from the fold out trundle and this is a perfect little end table. Not only is it easy to move when we roll the bed away, it gives easy access for our guests to plug in and charge things thanks to the ports on the shelf.<br />The rustic styling is really nice, I really like it!",1678646591594,0,false
5,Adorable for my girls' room,"I have 2 daughters sharing a small room and I have to admit we were concerned it wouldn't fit a chair and desk. But this chair is PERFECT for my little girls! It's comfortable but doesn't take up a lot of space. The color is really cute and just adds style to their room as well. It was not hard to assemble, and the quality is pretty great!<br />I've tried some other Sweetcrispy furniture and in general I'm pleased with the brand. Happy to say this just adds to that positive reputation.",1678642447185,0,false
5,LOTS of gold confetti!,"These are not your old standard poppers- these are the newer breed of confetti bombs that shoot a surprising amount of gold flecks everywhere! More like a mini Confetti Canon! Be warned, kids have a hard time setting them off, and it's possible if they don't get it right the first time it will be a dud. Parents should help if possible. Also these can be POWERFUL so make sure not to aim towards anyone's face.<br />There's warnings about it, but pay attention to them! Otherwise, really fun product to enhance any party!",1677809910956,0,false
5,"Fun colors, big numbers, really great for kids and gamers!","This clock is really fun- aside form the numbers being large and dimmable, you have many options in colors, changing individual parts of the display or setting it to be a uniform color in case the gamer-RGB vibe isn't for you.<br />The USB port is a nice touch for charging your phone next to your bed, and the LED light bar on the bottom makes for a cool night light as well. My son really loves it, and I'd totally recommend it.",1676913808860,0,false
5,Adds some class to your table,"We usually have hydrophobic tablecloths since there are kids in the house, but I forgot how classy a traditional linen table can look and feel. This is very well made, the stitching is quality and the slightly off-white color adds a perfect backdrop to a formal table setting.<br /><br />It might not be hydrophobic but it seems to resist stains well enough. It also cleans off easily enough that I'm not afraid to use it with my kids and their friends, just as much as I would a formal dinner with adults.",1676606721930,0,false
4,Large and great for pantries,"These come in different sizes, I opted for the 20 x 30 cm (7.8x11.7 inch) size. I see some other reviewers complained that they were expecting bigger bags, they picked the smaller ones. Let me tell you, this size is almost the dimensions of a sheet of paper. Because they are resealable, you can use them for things like beans and rice, which normally would spill in a cabinet or pantry if you don't have a sealable bag for them. They are also great for coffee beans, both storing whole and after ground. Useful to have around!",1675971643314,0,false
5,Perfect for front hall/closet shoes,"We have a specific area by the front door to hold our shoes, between the door and a piece of furniture. However we often have a lot of extended family visit, and that little area is not enough. I love that we can move the furniture out and extend this rack to fit more shoes as needed! I didn't know how much I'd love that idea until I saw it! I also really love that this is stackable, so as the winter months bring snow, we may need to add another layer to the top!<br />Note that this only comes with a single layer, you'll have to buy additional ones to stack. It was pretty easy to assemble, I'm very pleased with it!",1673897522482,0,false
3,Kind of unimpressed,"I've ordered pillows online before, so I had a pretty realistic expectation, I think. These claim to be real down and are admittedly nice feeling to lay on- They come vacuum packed and flat like all the others I've tried, as well.<br />Here's the thing: Maybe I'm just used to down alternatives, but these did NOT seem to fluff back up as much as expected after removing from the plastic seal. In fact, they seem kind of 60-75% full compared to the pictures on the product description. I gave it a weekend to finish decompressing before trying again, I tried hand fluffing, but it still sort of feels like a pillow that has been used for a few years to me. Not what I was expecting.",1673897091874,0,false
5,Substantial size and quality,"I was impressed taking this out of the packaging, it feels and looks even better than I expected. I love a large saucepan because they bridge that gap between frying pan and small pot. And 5 Qt is nothing to sneeze at, you could make a soup in here, or fry up some scrambled eggs or stir fry veggies if you wanted to! The handle is a generous size and the lid has a small hole to release pressure and avoid boil-over. It honestly looks so great on our stove, I'm kicking myself for not getting a new one sooner. Our older one is Teflon material and starting to show its age. I love the stainless steel, it's healthier (no more worrying about non-stick coating coming off in my food) and just looks so nice! Highly recommend.",1673386620009,0,false
5,NOW its a party!,"This is a super cute party set. My daughter just turned 10 and this set of disposables is just perfect!

It comes with pretty much anything you'd need for place settings, flatware, tablecloth, napkins... super cute, would recommend.",1673385208282,0,false
4,Great for keeping things neat and organized,"I got this for a guest room, in order keep decorative hand towels organized on shelf. It looks nice and the handles are a great touch.

I like to wake up and have my coffee ready in the morning, so this was a big disappointment.<br /><br />On the positive side, it is a nice coffee pot if you want to grind your own coffee beans.

Although it will bring a smile, i'm afraid it will not end up being used for the intended purpose.  I never grab the smallest spoon to get my peanut butter.

Now I find myself using one of them every few days... so of course I feel silly for waiting so long to pick up a pair. This set in particular seems well made and I expect them to last a long time.

3,"Works and Looks Good, But Needs a Redesign","I can't say this doesn't work, and it has nice features. I can only give 3 stars because of the overall design. You have to turn it over and fill it from the underside. That doesn't sound so terrible, and maybe could be worse, but it's kind of a pain. the carry handle is on top, and the bottom always has condensation, so you end up dripping water all the way to the kitchen. I suppose you could take the entire unit when refilling, but that would be annoying too. Also, the fill opening at first seems large enough, but that's only true until you want to wash the inside. I let mine sit way too long unused, and wanted to wash it with soap. The opening is too small for me to get my hand inside. I had to resort to a long soak and sloshing the soapy water around. I think it's clean enough? Then there were the times were the rubber seal on the cap came out and fell inside the tank. I hope you have kitchen tongs. And a couple times I accidentally tightened the lid too tight. There for a minute I didn't think I was going to get it open again.<br />Like I said, it DOES work, but it's annoying. I ended up replacing it with one that fills easily from the top. This one is now used only in the home office, so I don't have to fill it so often (but I still might totally replace it in this room, and donate this thing).",1674246447430,2,true

Unacceptable<br /><br />UPDATE 2023-03-03<br />2nd one arrived without the blemishes. hard to find faults with this design, but let me try... ok the pour is nice, the infuser is deep - has a little handle, the lid can be managed with one thumb, the whole pot can be managed with one hand, ceramic seems good.... what to pick on... what to pick on... ok... ok I got it. These are REAAAAAALY dumb things, but hey, I can't leave it well eough alone... 1. Not easy to clean the infuser - tea bits get stuck to the bottom so washing it is a pain - I'm sure there's a nifty way of cleaning it that I don't know, that saves time and water. 2. the plastic neck shroud should have been white... although... I can see the reasoning for black - wont get stained over time. 3. the handle could have been just a bit more ergonomic, like, include a curve where your ring finger goes to support and lift... 4. the bottom of the pot is concave. So if you put it on one of them pad warmers, it doesn't make solid flat surface to flat surface contact.<br /><br />Man you know what? Ok, I like this one. Not a bad piece of engineering.<br /><br />on and 5. would've been nice to include a little recess in the spout so when you're done pouring it doesn't drip...<br /><br />But... it's good... no its really good.

3,The cutie that couldn't,"I really wanted to love this little guy, and absolutely would have kept it, except for one thing - the infuser is too shallow - you have to fill it up all the way to the top and then as you pour tea and the water level drops, it's not infusing any more. Now some might say - that's exactly what's needed, because who wants vaying levels of tea strength - like, it gets stronger (if you keep it warm). My thing is, I want to get all the taste out of the tea leaves. And this infuser can't do that. Also, other kettles you can operate with one hand, as the handle is integral, and the lid is thumb actuated. But, there's something to be said about the bamboo handle - because it is not integral, it doesn't get hot.<br /><br />This tea kettle is awesome, well thought out, if you're doing a tea ritual and have time.

5,Great teapot!,"This teapot is really nice looking and well made. The design works so much better than the type where the strainer sits at the top of the teapot. This strainer goes all the way down to the bottom. It allows you to make less than a full pot if you want -- plus, it makes a stronger pot of tea!

I was planning on putting this in a body pillow that has a very thin cover, but I was worried since the non-memory foam pieces have on of their six sides that are very hard.

2,"Great for a few months, until it stops working","I bought this for one specific reason: to dry my towel after showering. It worked well until it stopped working entirely.<br />I got this in September and used it every day for 3 months. I used this in a standing mode, rather than mounting it to the wall.<br />The timer function worked great for me and the 4 hour one dried my towel a satisfactory amount.<br />3 months in though, I tried to turn it on and it refused to work. It went from working well to not turning on. After following some troubleshooting guidelines and contacting the seller, there was nothing to be done. Unfortunately, the warranty for this is only 90 days. The seller offered to replace mine but said it would cost $25 to mail a new one. Not really a good deal for something that has a shelf-life of 3 months and costs less than $60.<br />Spend money for a better one or you'll just be buying these over and over.",1677734592164,0,true

2,Nice size. Lid is an issue,"I like the size of this and that it's only two compartments with a divider. The wooden utensils are cute but not always practical. The major flaw is the wood lid. After a dozen or less uses, hand washing the lid, its cracked. And what's weird is its not cracked along a seam but across the top.<br /><br />The box as a whole is still functional but part of the overall price includes the lid and the lid holds the utensils in place. Not really happy with that aspect.",1673655094641,0,true
2,Is it over priced? YES Does it work? Yes it does what it's supposed to do,"Does it work? Yes. Is it over priced? Yesssss. I think I'll return it. My main complaint is that it does not heat evenly. The waffle part back by the hinge of the machine gets wayyyyy over done while the front will remain pale. I even played out with timing, like fill the front, wait, then fill the back. For $40 I expect more. If it was $15 machine I'd be happy with how it preformed.<br /><br />There is a learning curve but the first time we used it we made 4 decent waffles. Not like the fancy tea place makes but passable. You'll always get too much batter and have some run out when you close the lid. Pour in what you want, shut lid for 30ish seconds, then flip machine over for 2 mins, flip back, peak to see how it's cooking, and add time as needed. The hotplate that is in the bottom will cook quicker but its not a uniform cook.<br /><br />There is no ebook or whatever. There's a 4 page manual with a recipe on the back page. I wouldn't use that recipe. Maybe it's authentic but there are simpler recipes online. That recipe calls for 3 egg yolks and 6 egg whites.",1673196524460,1,true
4,Big foot print,"I ended up returning this before using. It's a very pretty, shiny kitchen gadget, feels solid, and I'm sure it works just fine however it was huge and heavy. It was also shallow compared to my stove top wok. It would take up a lot of storage space and it weighs like 12lb.<br /><br />I also didn't care for having to turn it over to attach the wok to the base. Maybe that's how all of them are but this seemed a lot of work if you also have a stove top wok.<br /><br />This would be excellent and multi purpose if you do not have a stove top.

3,Not For Me,"Smells like a muted version of the Island Margarita candle from bath and body works. I hate that candle personally but I don’t completely hate this candle since it was done better. I definitely wouldn’t repurchase. The genuine scent of a mint leaf dominates this fragrance, very herbal, leafy, not like toothpaste. The next most prominent smell to me is basil. I can barely detect any eucalyptus or ginger. It has a faint sweet smell to it too. For a 3-wick candle, the scent is pretty strong in my 2800 sq ft house but not obnoxious enough to give me a headache. Another reviewer said it smells like a spa which is what actually sold me, no, it does not. I do get how someone might get aroma therapy vibes, but as someone who has frequented many spas, it’s not a spa scent to me, or at least not a good one.<br /><br />Update:<br />I layered this candle by lighting another floral-forward candle next to it and it is now absolutely heavenly and 100% spa like. The candle I used I made myself, it has olive blossom (mostly), elderberry, and lavender. If you own another candle with a similar floral profile, give it a try. Maybe I’ll repurchase this candle afterall…",1673999939062,0,true

The only thing I have to be careful with is that the ""on"" button is on the front.  I have to be careful not to lay anything on top of it after I put it down as the fan will turn on without my knowing (as it is so quiet).  That's about it.

My old pillow was getting worn down so I went ahead and bought this one as a replacement and honestly it's just not my favorite. It works in a pinch, but it's just not nearly as comfortable as some of the other ones I have used in the past. I honestly think its the material of the pillow that is impacting my ability to sleep on it. I can fall asleep on the pillow, but my ability to stay asleep on it is not great. It feels almost a little too stiff, and not enough like a cradle. I probably wouldn't purchase this pillow again.",1677605572861,0,true
4,Great for Organizing,"With new furniture comes the need for new organizing systems. I bought these bins primarily because the lids make it easy to stack them.

5,Gets the job done,"I don't love wedges, they really are not my favorite thing, however for quality of sleep I really do need a slight wedge. I bought this one mainly because it didn't seem to steep and it also had the added benefit of preventing things from falling in between my mattress and headboard into the abyss of no mans land where I will never find my tv remote again. I have had it for a few weeks and I have to say it really works at preventing things from falling. As for the wedge itself, it is pretty stiff, which works out okay, and the angle isn't too bad. I will say that if you use two pillows this wedge will make your need be way to high up for comfort. But if you are a one pillow sleeper this might a good intro to sleeping with a wedge.",1673967660454,10,true

I think I would have rather had more variety than the same figure in two different options (sparkly and not).<br />That being said I am happy with the purchase, and it was fun through the holiday month.",1673441080245,0,true

4,Nice little rug,This is a nice little rug. It is thin so not a lot of added comfort but I have it in front of the sink to collect any potential spills during the usual washing and use while at the sink. This works out quite well although I have a little battle going on wtih the cats on where it should be. This is working out quite well though. It is a bit on the cheaper side but it was also not a very expensive piece. it is NOT one of those memory foam ones that keep the fatigue away but it wasn't what I really needed or wanted either so it all works out really.,1675434736521,0,false
2,Very underwhelmed,"This is a very lightweight shelf and I am rather disappointed. You do get what you paid for but I went mostly by dimensions and this fit what I needed. It seems I can go a bit bigger and will use this somewhere else for some light duty since I don't trust putting anything heavy, which I intended to, on this shelf.<br /><br />The assembly of it was pretty easy and it is light but it is not that sturdy and the legs, unlike most other wire shelves I have, can not be adjusted at all, and now it kind wobbles around. So I will have to put some piece of cardboard or something under it, or get one of those fleece furniture leg protectors or something to help with that issue.<br /><br />Another issue, you can't adjust the height of the shelves at all, so you are stuck with where they make you put them, again not a fan since one of the reasons I like these wire shelves so much is that they usually let you put the shelves at whichever height you want.<br /><br /> At least I can find some use for it since the hassle of returning this is just too much.",1674427082581,0,true

The thing that I don't like is that it feels like that most of the settings are very fast and strobe like. i wish there were more relaxing settings like a slow waterfall or something so they could work on that.<br /><br />I also don't like it is battery operated. like seriously? Can't you make this plug in or a rechargeable item in todays age? Why do we need to use batteries that get thrown out? And then they are too cheap to even include them?

Still not a deal breaker, just annoying<br />2nd, it has a removable silicon seal around the cover. It's what creates the airtight seal. This is my BIGGEST complaint. With coffee use, or any kind of drink that stains, it changes color extremely fast and starts to look grungy.

It didn’t last a month.  Flimsy plastic pieces had it falling off every other use!  Also the cushions didn’t last long at all.  But the worst thing was the weld joints on the bottom of the chair broke not even 5 months after purchase making the chair useless.  What a waste of money!  I would avoid this chair like the plague!  Cheaply made and weld joints were barely there!  I’m actually surprised the chair last 5 months after looking at the welds.  Also the part that makes the chair lean back were garbage!

I did not encounter any issues during the assembly process.  Note, there is extra hardware and the tools required to assemble are included.<br /><br />All measurement are accurate. Armrest are adjustable up and down as well as width wise. This is done when you assemble it.<br /><br />Once assembled I took it to my office sat down and sighed. It was like night and day from my old chair.  Felt like sitting on a cloud. Then I leaned back a wanted to take a nap.

4,Different but works well,"My curiosity led me to getting this.  I had never seen a stone bathroom mat before and thought, I have a place for it why not.<br /><br />First, it is solid stone about roughly 1/4 inch thick not too heavy.  Honestly, I’m surprised it made it through shipping in one piece but it was packaged securely and arrived with no damage.  Size of the mat is as described in the ad.<br /><br />The non-slip pad is made from good quality material cut to size…works well. The small sanding pad is handy for cleaning and is nothing more than fine sand paper.  It could be bigger however it is easily replaced.  Given the size of the cleaning sand paper they included it will be challenging to clean.  I’m going to be a bigger piece.<br /><br />How does it function?  It soaked up water well.  Feels weird on the feet and will take some getting use too but it works.<br /><br />Price vs product…hard to say if it is worth the price considering this is a first for me.  However, it is within a reasonable price range of similar products that I found.",1673730859242,0,false
3,Ok bag and not just a laundry bag.,"Not great but not bad either. Each bag came nicely package and I found no issues while unpacking. They are made from a linen canvass like material…appears somewhat durable and based on coating on the inside I would say water resistance not proof.  Measurements of the bags are within reason to what is stated in the ad.  At the top of each bag sew into the material is a metal rectangle to help it hold its shape.  However, they are not as square as the pictures would have you believe and will collapse easily.  Sturdiness improves with the addition of clothes as one would expect.  The ad claims they stand firm but I have to disagree with this statement.  There are two handles so it the bags can be easily carried and work good.  Some may find it difficult to get the handles over their shoulder  overall, the bags achieve its purpose of holding laundry.<br /><br />The bags could easily be used for other activities as well.  Toting things from the car to the sports field or beach.  In my opinion given the multiple uses, plus its ability to collapse and carry in your vehicle it is a average bag.  Long term I could see issues with durability.",1673656950752,1,false

I couldn't do it and had to ask Mom, our family fixer upper, to put them together. It even took her a while though she finally did get it done. Once assembled, I came up against a limit buried in the ad copy's fine print. These are for men's shoe sizes up to 9.5. I wear a size 13 shoe and they barely fit in these things. Also, if I move the boxes around at all, the back starts to pop off and it's hard to keep the front door closed. Take a look at the enclosed photo showing how messed up the instructions are.

4,An Interesting Concept But A Bit Of Overkill For Me,"I've never come across an automatic mixing cup before so the idea made me curious. The idea is a nice one and this cup does the job well. There are two things though that stop me from giving it a full 5 star rating. First, the only thing I drink that needs something stirred into it is a couple of cups of tea a day that I put stevia in. Stirring that with a spoon seems like a simpler, easier process than using a cup which needs regular recharging as well as careful washing to avoid getting water into the wrong place. The second issue is the size of the cup. 12 oz is fine for coffee or tea but for other things that need mixing like protein shakes, that does seem small.<br /><br />Those may be personal reservations though, which may or may not be important to you. The cup itself is well made and durable, with an attractive appearance. It recharges quickly and easily. If you would like a 12 oz automatic mixing cup, this one should fit the bill for you nicely.",1678295483202,0,false

I fall solidly into the second camp but your mileage may vary. I do have to say though that these forks and spoons seem to be well made and durable, with an attractive finish. If they had been only a little longer than other cutlery, I might have really liked them. As it is, I won't be using them much myself.

Under closer examination though, the design looks like it was cut out with an x-acto knife, leaving ragged edges that may be prone to fraying. If it wasn't for that, I'd have to give this rug at least four stars, if not five.",1677252029037,1,false

The lip around the shelves was a nice touch to keep his ""stuff"" from falling off the shelves. All and all, both he and we are very pleased with these shelves.

There were no instructions with it but they weren't needed anyway as putting this container together was intuitive and easy. The doors are a bit small but are workable. They also latch shut and open up again easily.<br /><br />There are two minor issues that kept us from giving it a full five star review. One is that the wheels on the bottom seem a bit flimsy, as you can see in the third photo attached here. We won't be stacking things on top of this container nor will we be wheeling it around so that is not a big deal for us. Still, you should be aware of those wheels. The other minor issue is that the container arrived with a crack on the front, as you can see in the fourth photo. The crack didn't affect the usability of the container in any way and it's not that noticeable. Again though, that is the kind of thing you should be aware of.<br /><br />Our techie teen also does a lot of different kinds of crafting. Atm he is into knitting so this container was immediately put to use helping to organize his skeins/hanks/balls of yarn. As messy as his room is, this container still adds an attractive touch to his clutter as you can see in the last photo. All in all, our family has to give this product a very enthusiastic 4 star rating.",1675720059424,0,false
1,Thin Wood-like Veneer Tape over MDF,The thin wood-like veneer tape has bubbled and now come off on the edges making this bookshelf look horrible.  Would not recommend at any price given the cheap construction and lack of durability.,1673647517739,0,true

4,So far this bed is awesome!,"At 5'9"" with a model like frame, I had to get help with the box b/c it's weighs more than I do.<br />After that, opening it and placing it on the platform was easy.  As soon as I removed the plastic, the bed started to inflation. It took 24hrs to get to its full size. However, I opted to follow directions and let it sit for more than 48 hours without touching it at all.<br />The corners of the bed are sturdy and did not collapses as shown in some pictures.<br />There was a smell but it was not strong. The smell dissipated once the bed fully inflated.<br />It took my body about three weeks to adjust to it.  I thought it was too firm at first but it turned out to be just right.<br />I have a metal platform frame and it sits well without sliding even though I have additional space on the frame.  Pics will come soon.  I had the bed for about 6-8 weeks and I love it.  I also noticed that I don't have back pain or feel stiff when I wake up.<br />The price was exceptional.<br />This is a great buy if you follow directions to the T.

However, I will provide updates along the way since I have yet to use them.<br /><br />I did not like that packaging because the foam they it is packaged in does not cover the entire cup.

I will utilize these mugs often and will provide on going updates in the future.<br /><br />Also, please be advised before purchasing that on the bottom of these mugs, it says hand wash only, wish means they may not be dishwasher safe.",1672861486279,4,true

They are strong and durable, and have held up well in my kitchen.<br /><br />I also appreciate how easy they are to use and that they can be applied in seconds. I simply wrap the cord around the cord organizer and it stays in place. I also like that they are removable and can be moved around if needed. I would highly recommend this product to anyone looking to keep their cords organized and untangled. It’s a great product and I’m very pleased with it.",1672792206151,0,false
4,a must have for nice pans and pots,"The sizes are great and it comes with 5 different sizes so you can fit them to any pot or pan.  They keep the pans from scratching each other and are surprisingly strong.  I had no issues with them slipping, even when I was stacking multiple pans.<br /><br />The material is a nice grey felt and looks great.  The edges are stitched and finished so that there are no frays or loose threads.  They're also washable which is a great plus.  They don't retain any odors or odors and they're thin which means they don't take up much space.<br /><br />Overall, these are great pot and pan protectors and I would definitely recommend them.  They do a great job of protecting your cookware and they look good too.  The price is great and the quality is great.  Definitely worth the money.<br /><br />PS  I think I would prefer silicone protectors better but these do their job well.",1672789895496,0,false
4, Not sure if the embellishments were needed!,"This is a fun candle but I am not sure if the embellishments were necessary. This candle, by Kelley’s Custom Candle Store, is fancy. There is a fan and rose embellishments. The candle itself is about 3.5oz. The container is black with gold lettering. There is some assembly required - you have to add the stem, umbrella and dangling roses. It’s cute, but not really functional. I suppose some will disagree saying the umbrella like embellishment provides a way to distribute the scent of the candle (which is floral), but it is not needed. In terms of the candle itself, the floral scent is not overwhelming/over-powering. It is pleasant and lingers for a while.  The candle is 100% soy wax with essential oils. The packaging is nice, great for gift-giving. And finally, it is affordable (under $22 on Amazon). So if you want a unique candle (one that people will definitely notice), this is the one for you.",1678303635076,0,false
4,My SON loves it! His smile makes me smile!!,"Personally, I’m not a DT fan, but my oldest son is. He finds Trump to be very entertaining. When offered this cup, I thought it would make the perfect Valentine’s Day gift. Of course, I could not wait until Valentine’s Day and gave it to him the same day it was delivered. Boy did he smile! He loves Trumps humor and  bravado.   The mug is basic - on one side of the white mug there is a standard Trump-ism/Trump rant, and on the other side is a red, white and blue heart with the label “Best Son Ever,” in the center. In conclusion, he smiles when he sees it, which makes me smile.  So while I may not like the man’s politics, I do like the way this gag gift makes my son smile.",1675826407027,0,false

3,Simple and Neat,"I've had this nightstand for quite a while now and I'm very impressed that it has actually lasted this long. Like any other product, there are pros and cons that come along with it. The pros are that it will not take up too much room, it gives you extra storage space, and essentially it gives you an extra outlet with the two USB ports. The con really is that the materials are very cheap and make the nightstand very flimsy. It can sometimes feel like a table that you can buy at a dollar store for far less (without the power outlets of course). The last con is if you plan of putting the nightstand against the wall the connector will get in the way and may possibly force a big gap between the wall and the nightstand.<br />Overall, it's a fairly simple and neat nightstand to have. If it ever lowers in price I would definitely buy again and possibly raise my review rating on price value.  Hopefully, it'll last you as long as it has lasted me if you decide to buy it!",1675398272078,3,true
3,Small Space Heater!!,"This product came on time and was packaged with other items.<br /><br />Pros: It actually heats. Compact and small.

If cost of electricity is no concern to you, then this is the perfect small space heater for you!",1678555191564,0,false

3,Coldest Water is not as described - Leaks,"I have only started using this for a few days after recent delivery. The great thing about this is that it does keep your water cold for many hours, BUT that’s if you have any water left in it. The bottle advertises as leak proof and this is NOT in anyway leak proof. Maybe I ended up with a defective one. Three times I couldn’t figure out why my protected Lazy Boy recliner sofa cover was wet.  I initially thought it was my puppy peeing but it had no urine smell.  On 3rd time I noticed wetness again and this time the top of cap was wet. The flip nozzle was completely shut and cap was tight. I am really disappointed about this. I usually use my Yeti bottles and I thought this bottle would be similar, but definitely NOT the case.  I plan to return the bottle.  And don’t get me wrong, I love the really thick straw and nozzle conception, but that doesn’t stop leakage.",1677185821455,0,true

It does look good but not being able to see the numbers is a problem for me. It is supposed to work on the top of a pot, I can see how it does, but that's not a very practical application for me.

2,Not Impressed,"While there are some good features for this cup and it does a pretty average job of insulating beverages, there are 2 negatives that make this a less than compelling purchase. For starters, the lid does not screw on and is neither secure nor leakproof. And while both a curved and straight metal straw set and cleaning tool accompany the cup, there is no dedicated insertion point for the straw. Instead, you must use it in the oval opening intended for sipping. The straw rattles around that opening and while it is possible to separately purchase silicone straw silencer sleeves, the larger problem is the fact that this opening substantially reduces the insulating effectiveness and results in your beverage losing either heat or cold far more quickly than a cup with a dedicated, tightly fitted straw opening. In fact, I purchased this cup as a replacement for a competitor’s model that eventually lost the gasket seal for its straw opening! Just that tiny round area being open to air dramatically reduced the overall effectiveness of its insulation and led to me purchasing this cup as a replacement. I did not expect the new cup to have an even larger open channel to the exterior! If you are looking for something that is truly well-insulated and seals tightly, you can pass this version by.",1675846355950,0,false

The straws are all in a fifth bag.<br /><br />HOW THESE OPEN<br />These unscrew and screw back on.<br /><br />STRAW<br />The straw has a stop in it so that if you pull it up from the straw, it will stop at a certain point.<br /><br />WHY DO I HATE THESE?<br />Before I go there, let me say I LOVE<br />-colors<br />-design<br />-straw stop<br />-lots of room for drink<br />-does not spill as much<br /><br />WHAT I HATE<br />-the covers on these have no grips.  They are almost impossible to get off half the time.  When they are cold, they get slick and forget it.  There should be a small raised tab on the top so you can use it as a way to put pressure on the lid to unscrew it if it gets stuck.<br /><br />THE BOTTOM LINE<br />I love the colors and the design, but I hate that they get stuck very easily and take a long time to get them open- EVEN WITH A RUBBER PAD GRIP<br /><br />MY RATING<br />TWO STARS.  Not being able to get this open is frustrating.  I had everyone in the family trying to open these when they suddenly get stuck.  No one could do it not even with the usual grip that works on jars that get stuck.  If these were made better, I would rate them higher.",1678377427314,0,false
4,"A Bit Thin, But Perfect For Melting Honey","We use a lot of honey.  That means that we will have to slowly heat the honey so that it will be liquid again to use it.

The rack is raised just enough to keep the jars off of the bottom of the pan, but still have them submerged.

Not sure how long they will last.<br /><br />MY RATING<br />FOUR STARS.  These should be a bit thicker to accommodate jars of food for canning.

2,This is the worst made product I've ever used.,"This item first was delivered to the wrong place entirely, customer service is almost non-existent.  Amazon refused to service the return right away so after waiting to get my money back, I bought a second one and the address was still wrong but somehow showed up to the front door.  The item itself is so cheaply made that it wobbles plastic around.  All the plastic on the object has sharp edges.  I owned a soda stream before and it had an electronic meter on the front of it that would light up.  It looks like to save money they removed all those features so it's total guess work how carbonated the water becomes.  If it's just slightly over carbonated (because there is no way to tell) it spews water all over down the counter and down onto the floor.  It also leaves a puddle in the machine under where the bottle would be.  It's ridiculously difficult to spin the bottle up into the mount which wasn't a problem before.  Trying to unwind the bottle while it condensates outside the bottle is nothing but hand slipping and a mess itself.  The water bottles themselves become unusable because they lose their seal and waste money and I mean within a couple minutes of trying to seal them properly.  Since the bottle has to wobble all over the place when someone unscrews a full bottle after charging it, shaking reduces the carbonation in the bottle, wasting more money.  It looks like the designer did everything they could to strip out any costs to make the item.  For someone who has a beautiful kitchen and someone comes over to ask about it, I dare not perform the action of trying to carbonate water in front of guests because it's a comedy joke to watch.  I'm not exaggerating here at all.  I buy an amazing amount of items on amazon each year and after doing so much research this was the only thing I've literally encountered in the time that made me regret the purchase.  Please choose a different model if not another product to do this.  On top of all this, the price of this item continues to go up far beyond what it originally cost for a previous better model.",1675983549210,0,true

3,My Review - So Far....,"I have 5 cats - 2 of them are older Maine Coons who have long hair and at the age where it sheds easily. I also have long hair. I got really tired of sweeping my downstairs twice a day from cat litter, etc. All but my bedroom downstairs has the ""fake wood"" flooring (no better way to describe it). In recent years, I've owned two Dyson Ball vacuums and neither have ever worked well and have needed frequent repairs. I've also owned a Shark Rocket vacuum and while it was easier to maneuver, the hose just below the floor attachment cracked and duct tape wouldn't cut it anymore. So.... I bought this one on Black Friday this past November. I really didn't care that one of the accessory attachments was ""missing"" - hardly use those anyway. Using this twice a day has made my upper arm chronically sore, but still easier than sweeping morning and night.<br /><br />Pros: it did what I wanted it to do and made my daily cleaning a lot easier, (other than the sore arm!). It sits nicely up close against a wall and easy to keep charged. It's also true that hair does NOT get wrapped around the brushes! I got very tired of having to cut out the hair every time I used my other Shark Rocket vac.<br /><br />Cons: One of the same reasons I hated my Dyson vacs, getting the hair out of the canister requires using my hands to sweep or pull it out. All the ""filters"" in the world in bagless vacuums are useless when you end up attempting to empty the canister! Plus the cat litter forms a powder that leaves a residue in the canister. Also, hair wound around the tiny front wheels in the first couple of uses and is virtually impossible to get back off. I don't even think they can turn anymore and it's been less than 2 months since I started using this machine. The bigger back wheels also squeak now. While the vacuum has plenty of suction power to pick up litter, cat food crumbs, etc., it will only do so when vacuuming forwards. Pulling the vacuum backwards, causes these things to be spit back out.<br /><br />I have yet to take this machine upstairs where I have all carpet. It does fine in the one room downstairs, so I'm not sure how it would do running it longer upstairs (still use one of my Dysons up there). So, my review is incomplete. Like I said, it's also only been 2 months since I purchased this. This is my first cordless vacuum and I love the cordless factor.  It's definitely kept my floors downstairs much cleaner than just sweeping (cut down on need to mop, which I hate) and my bedroom carpet has been much easier to keep under control, because it's much easier to use than my previous vacuum cleaners. However, with all the issues already present (especially with the wheels), it's questionable how long this thing will last. We'll have to wait and see, I guess.",1675057756369,32,true

2,Don't trust the glowing reviews; package frustration-heavy; construction wobbly,"It's true you don't need tools to put this together, as long as you don't mind it being wobbly as hell. If you want it to stay together, you'd better have a rubber mallet on hand and pray that you don't break the plastic connectors.<br /><br />Also, Amazon has a video of this thing installed around a washer, and I'm here to tell you that unless your washer is a mini, that's not happening. The area around my toilet makes it hard to fit this shelf unit, which I knew was a possibility, so I had thought that if that didn't work out, I'd use it in the laundry room. However, my entry level washer and dryer are both too wide to fit.<br /><br />Last chance is that I use this in the bathroom at work, but if that doesn't work, I'll be returning.<br /><br />The box is very dense and compact, which is nice, but even after you cut the tape, it's crazy glued making it extremely difficult to open, and even once you manage to pry open one side, everything is so tightly packed, you might not be able to get any purchase and wind up having to tear the entire box apart like i did. Most of the small pieces are in a sealed plastic bag, but not all of them, so keep an eye out for the ones that will roll away when you finally get the package open.<br /><br />One nice feature was the leveling feet, but otherwise I am very frustrated and disappointed by this purchase, even though I got it on sale. I definitely would not purchase again or recommend to others.",1673540870335,0,true

4,A nice container for dry goods; spout a bit small for cereals,"I purchased this for my mother to use with her muesli, with the knowledge that the spout would probably be a bit narrow for that. Turns out it was - however, it is a very well-built container which seals out air and is easy to handle on account of its vertical ridge. Being wide-mouthed, it allows her to dip a 1/4c measuring cup in there and scoop out muesli. Alternately, she can use the corner of the container to pour some out, since it has a squarish footprint. It is small enough that even when mostly full my mother can handle it well, and it fits well in the cabinet with the other cereal boxes. It is very well built, or feels that way.<br /><br />My only complaint - aside from the spout being too small - is that it's a -little- tricky to open due to the quality of the seal, which is first rate. You need to open it using the latch, which you can do easily so long as it is sitting down on a table - it is trickier to manage if you are holding the container in one hand and trying to open it with the other.<br /><br />All in all, would recommend. If you have finer dry goods, the spout would be nice to use, and otherwise you can open it and scoop out whatever you like.",1677008997271,1,true
4,Great choice for psyllium fiber powder,"I purchased this to store my psyllium fiber powder. Previously I had just been using an old Optifiber canister, and that was suitable enough. However, though I had no evidence of there being an issue, I felt like exposure to the open air probably wasn't the best for the fiber, so I bought this. It holds the exact same amount as the  Optifiber canister, and takes up about 1.5x the shelf space while being shorter.<br /><br />Pros:<br />The build quality - of the container itself, the lid, the latch, the seal, even the hinges - are all top rate. Very happy with that. It comes with a little 1TBSP measuring scoop that snaps onto the lid, which is convenient because that's exactly the amount of powder I use per serving. The container even has a corner to it, so I can pour out the last of the fiber powder into a cup when there's too little for the scoop to collect, something that was always an issue with the canister.<br /><br />Cons:<br />The container is a ~little~ tricky to pick up. This is because, unlike some of Progressive International's other containers, this doesn't have a ridge you can you to pick it up. I have average-sized male hands, and can do it with minimal effort. If you are female, or have otherwise smaller hands, you might need to use two hands to pick it up. Only an issue if you are doing this often, like to take off a shelf.<br /><br />The container is a ~little~ tricky to open. This is more of a use case thing, but I pick up my container, open it, and scoop out the powder, and since there's no handle on top of the lid, I have to open it using the latch. Maybe that's in the design - it is certainly robust enough  for it - but so far it is a bit awkward, since the quality of the seal means you have to apply slightly more force that you would for a simple plastic door. Probably wouldn't have that issue if I was opening it while it was still resting on the shelf.<br /><br />The plastic scoop as a ~little~ tricky to take in and put out - again, because I'm holding the container, so I have to do it one-handed. I might just leave the scoop resting in the powder instead, certainly won't hurt anything.<br /><br />Conclusion<br />I like the container and am happy to have purchased it. I liked the build so much I purchased another larger variant for my  mother to keep her Muesli, so she could mix up her own. I may buy another in the future for other dried good. Most of the cons are only related to my specific use case, so if they don't apply, would recommend.",1672768287252,3,true

4,Would recommend,"I bought these in Oct, waited to review to see how I would like them and truly be able to say if I recommend or not. Bought on Lightning deal. Have  arthritis so assembly took longer than it should but I was able to do it. The only issue was that after assembly one of the drawers came undone. The dowels and hokes not a great match but only on one table. Used wood glue and that fixed it. I like the convenience of the plugs on top and once assembled I find them to be very sturdy. I was pleasantly surprised on how much I liked them. Would definitely recommend. With some cute lamps and baskets they look good.",1678154470033,0,true
2,it looks very difficult to assemble,"I like how it looks, but I don't think I can assemble it without breaking some parts of it.  so I rather return it before I break it.  I didn't even try to assemble it myself.  (trust me, IKEA is much easier and better design for DIY)",1673669706829,0,true

The unit heats fine but won't warm a very big space on its own (maybe 200 square feet). It does work okay to maintain temperature in an already heated space.<br /><br />The controls are complete trash. There are two rotary dials one for heat out and one for three stages of power use. The heat dial is useless, it's such a small heater you'd never want it on anything less than full. The second dial may have a use but mine broke in less than a month of use!<br /><br />Within less than a month this unit is complete trash and no longer works.",1677438089736,2,true
4,These are great for protecting your counters,We have light marble counters and it's so easy to get them stained.  We were visiting family over the holidays and they had similar mats that they were using.  I ordered these because they looked the same but these were much thinner than what they had.  These still work great but they are a bit flimsy and a little hard to wash and dry.  They do look good on my counters and I have one under our toaster oven and another one under my espresso machine.  They seem to work well and are helping my counter not get stained.,1678159747480,0,true
3,Wish the handle was on top,"I like that these bins are stackable and they are useful for many things.  I use a couple of them under my bathroom sink to hold extras.  I also use a couple of them in the office for paper and things.  The one thing that I really wish these had was a handle towards the top of the pull out drawer.  Maybe it's because all of my other drawers similar to these have a handle on the top but also when you are leaning down to open one, it's easier if you can pull it at the top of the drawer than the bottom.  These have the indent on the bottom where you can grab it and pull the drawer out.  I do also wish they were a little shorter for some of my other shelves.  These are pretty good but I prefer other ones out there.",1678159279341,2,true

2,Unsafe for my pan,Bought it to use on a #9 cast iron frying pan (made in Erie PA by Griswold).  The holder slipped on nicely but was loose at the neck and flipped around. I was afraid there could be an accident with a holder that can flip and a red hot pan. (The handle on cast iron pans may vary a little from one to the other. Perhaps this holder would not be loose on a Lodge pan? I don't know - you would have to test it.) This holder was unsafe for my pan.,1678579280132,0,true
4,Do their job but sizing off,"I got tired of burning my hands on my old polyester oven mitts so thought I'd give these a try.  They definitely do their job and will protect your hands from getting burned.  And they clean up well.  But I'm a woman with medium size hands and very long fingers and these are HUGE on me.  In fact, they fit my husband who has extra large hands perfectly.  Too bad he hates to cook.  That reviewer who said back in 2020 that she has small hands and they fit perfectly?  Either her size small is my size extra large or the sizing is extremely inconsistent from year to year.",1676064470954,0,true

3,Disappointing packaging :-(,"Was horrified when these small, delicate trees arrived complete shattered during transit, after Xmas, as the seller had put this set of three trees together in a sealed thin plastic baggie—w/NO protective wrapping around any of them!! THEN an Amazon packer continued the thoughtlessness and put this bag loose (w/NO stuffing!) in a larger box with my shipment of a 2 lb bag of chia seeds….UGH!!  Could see that these would have been cute additions to my 35+ mercury glass tree collection, but since made with very thin glass they might always have been problematic, over the years, unless handled very carefully during storage/transportation :-/",1676154135309,0,true

3,Noisy bearing on the fan,"[[VIDEOID:c68f809e790de3f6737c8ad8aa0d3b0d]] This is an okay small air purifier. I do think the images are a little misleading on the product page since there are some that clearly show it being bigger. That being said, the dimensions are there for those that take the time to read the product description.<br />The pros of the purifier are:<br />It’s quick and easy to set up, the filter cartridge is made well, and you can turn off almost all the lights at any fan speed. It works well in a home office. The aroma pad is a unique feature, and some will really like it. It makes me wonder why they added it since they have a carbon element in their filter designed to reduce odor.<br />The cons are:<br />The bearing noise from the fan is noticeable and depending on the speed the noise can become higher pitched and make it less enjoyable to use. This could be an issue with just mine, but it doesn’t point to the best QC. Another annoying thing is the capacitive touch sensors for the buttons. They are finicky and as you can see in the video, you might need to push them multiple times to get a response. I would prefer physical buttons since there are only three needed. The last thing is more of a nuisance if you're sensitive to light when trying to sleep. The white LED, the only one you can’t turn off, is still bright and I have to rotate it so it’s against something that blocks the light. This won’t be a problem for some, but it is something worth noting.<br />Overall, my feelings are mixed and with the bearing noise combined with the annoying buttons, I can only give this filter three stars since the overall experience isn’t great. You might have better luck with this than I did, but I would look elsewhere at the moment.",1674924898392,0,false
1,Parts broke after a week!,"This kettle contains about as little plastic as I could find and I really liked it for that reason - the two plastic pieces are the lever to turn it on (which another reviewer posted broke quickly!) and the cover of the temperature gage - which broke in less than one week of use (pictures attached, looks like plastic just broke at the hinges where this piece is close to the metal of the kettle, which does get hot)! Though the kettle still boils water, I am very unhappy about ANY product that breaks in less than a week of light use!!! I am also concerned that the temp gage is now wobbly and unprotected, and its only a matter of time before it breaks and possibly compromises the inside of kettle... Save your money for something better!!!",1674131703624,1,true
4,Does everything but toast.,I’ve heard so much about air fryers I just had to get one.  Since this also toasted I threw out my old toaster oven.  I can’t really say much about the quality of this air fryer since I’ve done so little with it. It’s somewhat intimidating and I’m still learnt how to use it. But I’m a huge Breville fan.  But as a toaster this gets one star.  IT’S HORRIBLE!  Instead of the usual 3 minute toast this literally takes 6 1/2 to 7 minutes to toast bread.  Since it takes so long the bread looses all of it’s moisture and is like chewing on dried croutons. It also toasts very unevenly.  Unfortunately I then had to buy a toaster.  Just didn’t have the room for another appliance.  I’m debating on whether to get rid of the air fryer.  I’ve since decided that I really don’t like fried food that much.  This was an expensive lesson.  In the end I guess I just wanted another toaster.,1672565350579,0,false

4,Almost Pink Perfection,"The best part about this mug and cloud set is definitely the cloud, it is so adorable and really makes this mug into an event when you use it.<br /><br />Here are some lovely things I like about it;<br /><br />The mug is very steady once it has been placed atop the cloud and I think the cloud sorta extra insulates the bottom of the cup so my cup of hot chocolate stayed warm longer.<br /><br />The mug is not very big, in fact it is just the right size for a normal size cup of tea or hot chocolate, any larger and the drink will be tepid by the time I am done sipping it.<br /><br />The handle is for one finger, which makes it feel very secure, something I was a bit worried about but it is thicker than regular mugs so there doesn't seem to be an increased instance of droppage.<br /><br />Now for the one thing I do NOT like about this mug; the wording on the cup is odd and offputting, it feels like some swag you would get if you were heading to a matchmaking convention or some kind of business women informational seminar, it just rubs me the wrong way and the only saving grace is that it is super light and can barely be read.",1677878470975,0,false
3,So far I've managed some tiny donuts,"This little donut maker is super duper cute and it doesn't take up very much room which is great becase cupboard space is limited in my kitchen.<br /><br />The problems I have with this tiny cooker is that I think it doesn't get hot enough consistently enough.<br /><br />I tried the most basic recipe first, a very simple vanilla donut.  I had a tiny bowl of pink glaze and some rainbow sprinkles to add to the tiny cooked donuts but it simply took way to long to make them.  Every time I opened the lid all the heat escaped, so in all, it took around 18 minutes to make one tiny batch (that doesn't include the time spent making the donut batter, mixing glaze waiting for the donuts to cool and then cleaning the machine.<br /><br />The removable plates are a dream to wash, nothing sticks ad they are not very big.

4,Almost Perfect,"These frames are really darn cute.  Each one has the roughspun cotton string loop that you can use this to hang from tree branch or on a nail on the wall.  They are small enough that you could hang these along with stockings with photos of the stocking owners.<br /><br />The ideas I have for decorating with these little frames are endless.  But there is one little thing I do not like about these little frames are the Christmas pictures, they were all kinda ugly.  Opinions vary, but each one was slightly uglier than the last, a gallery of unclaimed misfit christmas art.  So I swapped them out for prettier images.<br /><br />But like I said before, these are great little frames and so well made.  Because they have a rough wood look, if you want to paint the frames you will need several coats of paint.<br /><br />Something else you should know, there is no matting or glass.  But they are so small, I don't think they need either of those things to look cute.",1677704172597,0,false

3,Arrived dented and it seems a little flimsy to be honest,"So this item wasn't packed very well and one side of the grates is dented in, now I wouldn't normally hold it against a product, they aren't in controll of the packaging or how rough or uncaring the delivery is, but it seems a little bit gragile, the sides were easy to bend back into mostly th normal shape and that gives me some worries about how this grater will hold up to regular use.<br /><br />Will it bend inward if I grate some particularly touch parmesan?  Will a extra sharp cheddar be it's downfall?  Should I hold off on the nutmeg atop my eggnog latte?!<br /><br />Anyways, I am just going to use it as intended and hope for the best.<br /><br />As a bonus, I think it is pretty enough to have it on an open shelf.",1676325350201,0,false

1,Drab and Dull,"This is possibly one of the ugliest rugs I've ever had, on a scale of horrid to burn it and spread the ashes far and wide, this rug is in a category of its own.<br /><br />Here are all the reasons I don't like this rug;<br /><br />1.  It has a thready, wispy, slightly matted appearance.  The rug arrived tightly rolled up, sealed in plastic and cardboard yet it has the look of a rug that has been well loved by several dogs, rodents and children who roller skate indoors.<br /><br />2.  The color fades from slight grayish blue to faded coffee stains and boot prints of possible dog poop origin.  This rug looks like a carpet removed from a home as a cautionary tale for people thinking wall to wall carpet in the bathroom could be a fun look.<br /><br />4.  Every bit of this rug is barren and spent.  The hints of blue that I was hoping for appear to be 'decoratively' covered with swamp water and sorrow.<br /><br />5.  The rug is a bit on the thin side and even with rug tacks, it still curls up on the edges.  Some of the 'faded' colors that mellow the blue triangle pattern seem to match the grout on my tile floor, which I just do not care for at all.",1674662503072,0,false

I just don't like the way they look at all.<br /><br />They came with tiny, double sided stickers/adhesives, these do work to hold the butterfiles to surfaces (not uneven or textured surfaces, so keep that in mind).<br /><br />I ended up placing a few on my tiny filing cabinet, I love butterflies and I hate that they are going to waste, but I don't like the way they look so I will be removing them.

4,A Great Bath Mat Except Not For Non-Slip Surfaces in a Tub!,"When I found this mat I did not see anywhere that it was not for non-slip surfaces in a tub. I did not realize that the suction cups simply would not grip onto the non-slip surface. So while this is a great bath mat and has no odor and is very well made I guess it will not work for me. Standing on it is very comfortable and it will probably fit most tubs I imagine! So I hope it will work for you, just not going to work on my tub specifically. So make sure you do not have a non-slip surface on the bottom of your tub!<br /><br />~The Rebecca Review",1678145272547,0,true
4,Pros/Cons for a Great Air Fryer!,"If you are looking for a well-made air fryer that can handle a lot of food this may be a great choice. I will say however that it takes a little breaking in and you should run it several times without food in it and keep fans on and windows open otherwise you could set off smoke alarms initially so you may want to wear earplugs just in case. But with further use this should not be an issue.<br /><br />So here are the pros and cons of getting this particular air fryer:<br /><br />Pros<br />Doesn't take up much more room than an Instant Pot or Crock Pot.<br />Easy to operate (even I figured it all out in a matter of minutes)<br />Simple controls anyone can understand.<br />Large basket for lots of French Fries.<br />Good instruction booklet.<br />Lot of cookbooks available and less work than turning on a stove.<br />Produces delicious food that is crispy and hot.<br />Even heat distribution over all food in basket.<br />Timer and temperature controls.<br />Easy to push touchscreen that works well.<br />Easy to pull basket out of fryer and not too heavy.<br /><br />Cons<br />Can't spray oil into the basket (some recipes say to do that but I think tossing the food in oil is safer)<br />Can't put liquids in the basket (some recipes do call for this but apparently it is not recommended.) I assume beaten eggs are not considered a 'liquid'.<br />A small amount of time like 3 minutes to wait around while the air fryer heats up to temperature.<br />Need to wear some small hand mitts to take things in and out of the hot basket.<br />Outsides of air fryer do get fairly warm so don't touch the sides when heated and not cooled yet. That is simple to do.<br /><br />I have about 5 cookbooks with delicious recipes I want to try and have been dreaming about what is possible. This looks great on the counter and this is made by a very reliable brand. With other air fryers I had considered being recalled I think this is a safer bet.<br /><br />One thing however that is confusing is that the instruction booklet says the basket is supposed to be washed by hand, while here it says it is dishwasher safe. What the heck, I'm thinking I'm going to try putting it in the dishwasher and see what happens. lol I do not like washing things by hand!!!! It looks like it will be fine, but read the instruction booklet for yourself.<br /><br />Enjoy!<br /><br />~The Rebecca Review",1675313415399,69,true

4,Great for Clay,"I wanted a roller that had thickness guides and not too big. This is small, and is great for polymer clay. I have acrylic rollers but wanted to try and see how this fondant roller would do and it's great. The thickness guides don't seem that great, they are not stiff enough so when you push down to roll it the guides are too soft and give a little, so the thickness measurements are not real accurate. It might work out better for fondant. The polymer clay doesn't stick to the roller and I think it works better than an acrylic roller, especially for a softer clay. Great tool to have. If you use fondant, unless you are working with small pieces I would probably get a larger roller. They have this one in a bigger size.",1675182424594,0,true
3,"Not 15 ounces, Pale Design","I ordered the Morning Meadows (simple bird), recieved Perfect Pastures. They are similar so I just decided not to hassle with a return, and just use it.<br />The colors and design like otheres have said has a lot more muted colors than what the pictures show. That's disappointing. The mug says it's 15 ounces, but putting on a scale filling water to the brim it's just a hair under 14 ounces. If you pour coffee in it where your not spilling it, it's comfortable at a little over 12 ounces. That too is disappointing.<br />The mug is very light, and pretty thin, I did microwave for about 45 seconds heating tea no issues. The handle didn't really get hot, so that's good.<br />The mug with a muted pale design, the wrong ounces advertised and honestly the style of the mug looks very basic, I would not purchase another one.",1675098330708,0,true
3,Good and Not So Good,"First, I do like the look of the vacuum, it also came with a few attachements that do work okay. You have to place the hose in just right to get much suction with the attatchments. The charge is great, it stayed charged pretty good and it's nice to have a USB-C charger for it. The bag it came in was fine, the cleaning is not so great. You have to pull the filter out and shake out all the dust off it each time you vacuum. A seperate screen to keep from hair or bits getting all over the filter would have been better. That is a really big pain. I would say it's an okay vacuum for the desk area, or a small room or quick pickups. It probably loses suction too quick too because the filter quickly get's clogged. The  seller sent me a card asking me to give a five star review in exchange for a thirty dollar gift card, and once I give the review would respond back to me in two days, because they may be filing bankruptcy soon if they can't sell enough of them.

The buttons did not register the first descaling so I did it a second time. Annoying, but fine. I thoroughly rinsed all of it, according to manu directions.  Now this morning, the frother, will not work. I looked on the manufacturer’s site, and everywhere else you can think of. According to the button pattern, it needs to be repaired by the manufacturer.

YES it does off gas as it burns. I left my flue closed and also tried it open and the whole house ended up smelling like burned fuel no matter what. The manufacturer insists the product has zero smell when burning therefore won't take responsibility ""are you using a Regal Flame insert"" is the response but they also say you can use it in other inserts - makes buyer pay return shipping. If you want to crack a window as some of the other comments say to do, then sure try it - but be aware you will likely end up eating the shipping costs if you can't tolerate the smell and want to return it. I am debating just to keep and using outside. The seller is responsive but not offering return shipping on a defective product is bad business in 23' so I won't be shopping with them again.

4,Makes the best tasting cup of coffee,"[[VIDEOID:6a8ed90a3992acfc26282c0dd82f55d8]] The De'Longhi TrueBrew Drip Coffee maker with built in grinder is amazing, with one short fall.<br />Let's get into what I love about it.  First, the quality is amazing- as it should be for the high price.  I wasn't expecting anything less.  Installation was completed within a few minutes after I washed the necessary pieces.  It comes with 2 manuals, a QuickStart guide, and a more in depth manual.  I filled  the water tank, and removed the lid at the top to fill with my favorite Mayorga coffee grounds and made my first cup of coffee within 15 minutes of setup.<br />The machine is simple, you press the column of buttons on the right to get the size and brew strength, and then you press 'brew'.  Simple as that.<br />When you press brew, the machine immediately begins grinding the coffee grounds according to your selected cup size, and then begins brewing.  It's not a quiet machine.  But, you have to understand that it's literally grinding your coffee grounds each time you make a cup.  It can't NOT make a sound.  And to be frank here, when I'm making a cup of coffee, it's to wake or re-energize myself.  So, I would welcome the sounds of coffee bean grinding, and brewing to aid in waking me up! For a 12 oz golden cup of coffee, the machine takes about 1:50 minutes from start to finish.  I included a video of this exact selection for an idea, and to share what it sounds like.<br />But, honestly other than the medium level of noise it makes from grinding the beans (and the sound of the machine auto cleaning itself at a later time by making the coffee bean puck to dispose into the inner removable waste bin), it's a quiet machine. I love that it cleans itself afterwards, and that I don't have to clean it out each time I want to make myself a cup of coffee!  Being able to clean out the machine just once at the end of the day has got to be one of my favorite features.  the machine also notifies the user if the waste bins are full, the water tank is low, and if the coffee bean tank is empty.<br /><br />You can use pre ground coffee beans too.  It's a little messy.  It comes with a scoop for you, to scoop into the little hole behind where the whole coffee beans go.  This scoop is too big. No matter how little I scoop, the grounds still fall onto the lip of the hole, so I'm left having to use my fingers to push some of it in.  I've used it about half a dozen times, and there are still remnants of the grounds on the top edge of the hole that never made it into being a cup of coffee, because it's just too hard to get in.  The coffee that is made from preground beans is mediocre in my opinion, so it's not worth the troubles that I just noted for me to make.<br />Also, you NEED to follow the instructions in the manual when making preground coffee.  You can't just toss it in and brew.  You have to select that pre ground first, and then only after you see the pre ground icon blinking, do you scoop in your grounds.  You don't follow this, you're grounds will be thrown into the waste bin when you press brew, and the machine makes you a fantastic cup of coffee tea.<br /><br />Negative:<br />1. The cleaning of this machine is a bit messy.  I wouldn't wait for the machine to tell you that the bins are full.  I did that the first round, and I regretted it.  There was coffee grounds everywhere, mixed with water- in the pull out compartment and the main machine.  Took me a good 20 minutes to clean everything up.  So now I clean up every night, or after 4 cups of coffee. Even with that, there is still a mess inside.  Coffee water gets into the center part of the pull out compartment, so I wind up having to rinse out this compartment that holds the waste bins each time.  Along with that, the main body of the machine always has coffee water on the floor of it.  Most likely from when the water that should all be going into the water waste bin drips into the center part of the pull out compartment.  When I pull out the compartment from the main body, the water that's dripped in the center must slosh onto the main machine body.  Every time I clean the machine, I need to lift up the front a little so that I can clean underneath for any of the dirty coffee water that's seeped into there when I pulled out the compartment.  So yeah, cleaning is a a;sfjsogi.  I'm confused why this happens, and I've troubleshooted whatever I could, but it still happens.  I may reach out to the company to see why it's happening.  I've added a photo to show what I'm talking about with the mess the machine makes.  This is right when I've pulled out the front compartment (I've been calling it the 'pull out compartment').  Note that below those full bins lies that coffee water I've mentioned.  Although I love this machine, I've got to take away a star for this.<br /><br />Verdict: Despite how messy it is to clean, I would buy this machine again if I had to.  It's robust, well made, looks good on my counter, and most importantly- it's made the best cup of coffee I've had to date. And I drink a lot of coffee.  I don't see or expect this machine to fail on me any time soon, and I hope to use it for a few years.",1678288342572,3,false
1,Broke on first use.,"The only nice thing I can say about this press is that it's pretty. The light pink and gold cutout hearts sold me on the press, and I wanted to replace my well love bodum press with it. But it looks like I'll be using my Bodum press.  Why?<br />Because this pretty little press broke on my first use when I went to press my very first cup of coffee with it.  When I went to press down,  heard a crack and my coffee started dripping out from the bottom.<br /><br />I'm left with a metal spoon. So, I'll review that.  It's a nice spoon. Using it for my sugar container.<br />Major fail.  I might try to find a glass carafe of the same size to replace in there, but I'm not sure I want to go through the trouble.

1,Just another flat pillow with no support,"Had high hopes, but no.  The pillow itself is stitched well, and the fabric feels nice to the touch.

I wouldn't recommend if you're looking for neck support.  I got this to use in rotation with my Elviros cervical 2-1 contour memory foam pillow that I LOVE, when I'm having the covers washed for that.  But, I'd honestly rather just use one of my plain, basic pillows instead.  They have more support that this one.

4,Nice solution for noise and potential pests,"This draft stopper is installed on my basement door to keep out drafts and any potential pests that may come through.  Installation was easy, the stopper arrives with the foam out of it, which is most likely because the stopper would be wrinkled and unusable if it were to be sent rolled up already assembled.  You just slide the foam pieces inside of the draft stopper, and you're good to go.  I opened my door, placed the stopper under it, and cut off the portion that hung over.<br />One thing I had to do was put double sided tape on mine. Because my door closes right at the edge of the top step, so the draft stopper falls down on the end that swings out, since there is no floor under it when the door is opened.  Wasn't hard, just put tape on both ends, and one piece in the middle, and it solved it.<br />I'm taking away one star, because the foam inserts push out on the end by the door opening from opening and closing the door (the hinge side of the door presses against the draft stopper on that end, resulting in the foam insert pushing out about 1/4 inch).  Everyday, I'm pushing the inserts back into the casing.<br />Would I get it again? I'm not sure. I was debating between this and the typical slide on ones from Frost King.  When this one eventually needs to be replaced, I'll probably try the other one since I wouldn't have to add tape to keep it on.  But, this one is worth its value in my opinion. It's a universal fit, fits my skinny door just fine.",1676651837284,0,false
4,Just ok,"This is a quality lumbar pillow, and my favorite feature has got to be the little pocket that allows for an ice or hot pack.  I’m relying on using the packs with the pillow, because although the pillow does offer some relief to my lower back, I feel like the pillow is just a little too soft for me. The use of a heat pack in the pillow has been offering some added relief.<br />I think that if this pillow didn’t have the ice/heat pouch pocket, I wouldn’t be using it because it’s not hard enough for me.<br />Would I get it again?  No. It might work for others, but I need something with more density to it.",1676445321706,0,false
4,Sleek looking bar cart,"I love this bar cart.  It was pretty easy to put together, although when I did put the glass bottoms in, I realized the top portion didn't have 90 degree angles because the glass didn't fit perfectly.  So, being a perfectionist, I took it apart and put it together again, but still resulted in the same outcome.  After a lot of thinking, I decided to keep it because the glass bottom didn't hit the metal parts, so at least I didn't have to worry about any potential possibility of the glass shattering from rubbing against the metal.  Also, I can't see it when I'm looking at it from the couch. Only when I'm hovering over the top of it, looking straight down.<br />The bar cart does seem pretty sturdy, and I don't feel worried that it will break or shatter from me putting  bottles and cups down on it.  The wheels work great and it moves around smoothly, brakes also work just fine.<br />Verdict:  Although the assembly went a little down hill, I'm still happy I got it because it looks really good in my living room.",1676404202066,0,false
1,"Not so easy to install, already peeling","I didn't think this would be as floppy as it is.  Yes, I knew it was going to be flexible since the listing shows it rolled up.  But, it's so floppy, that I had a lot of trouble applying it in a straight line instead of a wobbly one.  Also, not sure if it's because my door is unfinished plywood, but the adhesive doesn't seem to agree with my door over time.  While it did stick when I applied it (cleaned the door as instructed), now every time I go to move the door now, the edge that is on the end that is opening lifts up.  Dirt has already fallen onto the exposed adhesive due to this, and I know I'm going to have to rip this off in maybe the next week or two.<br />Please, DO NOT buy this thinking that the draft stopper is going to have perfect 90 degree angles once it's installed- as it looks in the listing photos.  The edges are more of a soft curve due to the very flexible material.<br />Would I buy it again? No.  Once this falls off even more, I'm going to buy the Frost King ones I've used in the past.",1675138817947,0,false
4,Cute thermos for a witty mama,"First, need to mention that I had to order a replacement, because the first one had some weird brown stuff on the rubber gasket from the lid. The lid also didn't seal shut either.  There were also scratch marks on the design and the cup.<br />The replacement that came is fine.  The gasket is fine and there are no dents or scratches on the design or cup itself.  The design is hilarious, and it makes me smile whenever I see it.<br />The extras that come with it are great, I especially like the straight stainless steel straw.  The cleaning supplies are nice too.  I'm keeping them to the side to use once my current thermos cleaners need to get tossed.<br />While it's not going to keep my coffee hot for hours on end like my zhojirushi thermos but it keeps my coffee nice and hot while I'm working at my desk, or when I'm going out for short periods.<br /><br />Verdict: Although the first one was bad, the second was great- and for the low price it's offered at with all of the extras it comes with, I'm still happy I got it.  I would recommend it.",1675058531905,0,true
4,Good for pet odors,"I wanted this to use in every few months to get rid of pet odors that I've become nose blind to.  Had to air out for over an hour though, not the 30 minutes stated in the listing because I didn't like the smell the machine left.<br />After using it, relatives have said it's gotten rid of the 'dog smell', so it does work.  In all honesty, after using this- as I mentioned in the beginning of my review, I don't plan on using this frequently.  Only whenever I feel the need to.  The inconvenience of removing everyone from the house while it's running, airing the room out for almost 2 hours, and the potential hazards it may have to my pets make me wary of using it the suggested every week.<br />I'm still glad I got it, since just opening a window won't do much in getting rid of dog smells.",1674876817825,0,false
4,Nice mat for my coffee station,"This coffee mat is a perfect size for my small coffee station in my home office.<br />The mat arrived rolled up and sealed in plastic.  It rolled out and stayed flat, which was a relief.<br />The print is really nice and subtle, although there are multiple white spots where the print didn't make it onto the mat.  Since the mat is a dark color, the white spots pop out which is a little annoying to me.  It might not bother others though.<br />I've already spilled coffee onto it, and the mat absorbed the coffee immediately!  I haven't cleaned it yet, so I can't say anything to how well it washes.<br />All in all, this mat is nice and seems like it will hold up to daily use.  Happy I got it.",1674003965383,0,false
4,"Works in my Ninja Foodi, gloves could be better","This silicone pot liner works in my Ninja Foodi, with it collapsed down.  I never thought I'd be able to find a reusable liner for my foodi since it has such a low clearance, but these liners work perfectly as long as they're not expanded.<br />The gloves I'm not using for the oven.  When I was cooking at 350 degrees, the rack melted the surface of my gloves when I pulled it out. I'll maybe use them for my microwave, nothing else.<br />Verdict: Although the gloves are useless, I'm still happy I got this.  The price for what you get (2 liners, a pair of gloves) is so low, that even with the useless gloves, it's still a good buy.",1673586008630,0,false
1,Arrived damaged.,"This under sink organizer looks sleek and high quality in the listing photos, but what I received was quite disappointing.  It arrived packaged neatly in it's box, so I was happy there- but as soon as I got it together, I saw that it wasn't at a 90 degree angle, and the bottom drawer was crooked.  I guess I received a defective one, or the quality control for this is terrible.<br />I needed to adjust the frame, which was alarmingly easy to bend.  The frame being so easy to manipulate means that it's not very sturdy OR durable, so I don't want to put anything that I would be mad about breaking in the upper basket.  I had originally planned on using this in the laundry room, to hold things with some weight to them, but I'm not so sure now.  Even after adjusting, the back of the frame is still off.  As shown in my photos, the top of the back of the frame leans forward 1 1/8 inches away from the wall.  The back basically is leaning forward.  It's annoying.  This wasn't a case of damage during shipment, as the packaging was great.  This is just bad quality control, which is disappointing since it's pretty pricey in my opinion.<br />To be honest, I have it on the side of my kitchen floor right now holding nothing as I figure out what I should use it for.  The only good thing I can say about this organizer is that it was easy to put together.  So, one star for that.<br />Verdict: Fail.  Would not buy again, quite honestly I just want to return it.  I wouldn't recommend it.  For the price, I expected far better.",1673237241380,0,false
2,Almost impossible to use with chocolate,"I bought these molds to use with chocolate.

It was hard to see the details on the dragon that didn't break, from a little distance away, you couldn't even tell it was a dragon at all. These will probably work much better with fondant but for use with chocolate I cannot recommend them.",1678809760731,0,true
3,So much lint comming off,Whenever I buy towels I throw them in the wash first. Same with these. But every time I dried myself with them I ended up covered in white lint from head to toe.

I wish the end had some type of weight of another hook for tension, because even with the ears for weight we ended up needing to put a nail in the middle and end of the strand to make sure it stayed in place on the wall when adding/removing a pair.

In two of my pics, you can see an undamaged backrest and one where that piece snapped off.<br /><br />To me, the flaw is that they didn't take into consideration how these chairs would respond to being stacked.

That being said, the directions are actually wrong! First of all, the ""B"" pieces: It comes with 4, but only shows where to use two of them. After fully assembling the wrack and realizing it was too short I was able to figure out where they go (Step 1, it shows you using 2 B pieces, but you'll use all 4), but still, they needed to mention that. Also in Step 1, it tells you to use the long screw, and then Step 2 tells you to use the short screw, but those should be flip flopped! Use the short screw in Step 1 and the long screw in Step 2. In Step 1, it also wasn't clear when you use the screw vs the suction cup, but if they would have included all of the B pieces I think it would have solved that confusion. Finally, one of the suction cups wouldn't screw on all the way, the screw stripped immediately I guess, so I'm just hoping it's in enough to hold everything together. Once you get it assembled, though, it's easy to adjust the shelves and there's lots of storage space, so ultimately I do like it! They just need to fix their directions.",1673540535521,5,true

The rubber spinner brush also gets warped pretty quickly. The filter doesn’t snuggly snap in which allows extra dust to get into the cavity it’s supposed to protect! Can’t complain about the side brushes and the red cleaning kit it came with is pretty great.

My husband likes a firm pillow and said after the first night that these didn’t have enough support. If you pick them up in the middle the filling goes to each end leaving you with just empty fabric in your hand. I can’t really speak to the cooling abilities since we have had them only a few days and the winter nights do enough to keep the pillows cool.

I guess that’s evident just from the fact that it’s stainless steel, but when using it that makes a difference. Finally when pulling up hot liquids, this baster gets really, really hot to the touch.

I am not a sewer, so I tried to fix with Gorilla tape and that is not working either. Seems like they should use stronger thread/stitching for the bottom, or have a support base under the bags.

3,"Would have loved, if worked.","Initially I was super excited about this hanger due to the durability(not the colour) and staggering design. However, hanger has the following issues:<br />1. Hang curve is too big to fit space above closet rod so requires one to turn it to remove n put back. This matters to short people like me as it's difficult to reach.<br />2. The curve on which clothes hang is too short so my clothes(petite) slip off. This only works with sweatshirts and shirts - not for V necks or more open necks.<br />3. The plastic is a little rough so anything made of chiffon or silk will snag ever so slightly.<br /><br />This is a good design that should be executed with adjustments as above. This did not work for me.",1675322650884,0,true

Strap is better than others but not durable.<br />4. See through top(sheerness)<br /><br />Could be better:<br />1. Pull strap could be better in that the ribbon should be sewn around the whole thing or through to 50%( a 90 degree angle) for the strap to be reliably used.<br />2.

3,"10% room, 80% visibility, 80% organization","The other reviews have assessed this item accurately. It delivers well on visibility and organization but not on space and ease of access. Space is compromised because the clips stick out and turn forwards and backwards leading to minor clothing tangle ups. Adding to these, if you move the hanger, it turns which is fine but then the long ends get tangled in things. I was really excited about these but they don't work for me because:<br />1. I do not want to risk ripping or tangling my clothes<br />2. Hard to move as they are heavier when you actually use all staggers.<br />3. Hard to use because my closet requires me to reach up vs being more at my height.<br />4. The end black pieces were falling off which is super annoying. One could just add glue which may prevent them falling off.<br /><br />The clips were ok for me but I can see how one may struggle with them. The clips screech a touch. They also have not sharp but not dull edges. Additionally the twist forward and backward which adds to tangling and space issue. Good for closet that has space.",1674546421310,0,true

It's not meant to hang heavy things as clear from the how this the rods are. They will bend if you hang heavy things.<br /><br />It creates some room in the closet but what it truly delivers is organization. It has its limitation on visibility but figure if you keep it where it belongs, you can find it when you look for it.<br /><br />Update:<br />So I ended up returning these and getting another style, plastic staggered hanger. Reason is it was more stable, not as heavy and slightly cheaper. This is a good product but given I only can use half of my closet(top), it was not for me.",1674098387697,1,true
4,"Delivers 80% on visibility, 80% on organization and 20% on space","Limited closet space and a desire to utilize vertical wasted space in a closet. I generally do not think these work and have seen the likes of such contraptions over the years(dry cleaners daughter so seen all sorts of versions of this). However, I am trying this because I do not plan to move this a lot (anything manipulated too much is subject to breaking down).<br /><br />I like that this allows me to stagger the pants(hung 2 pairs per rod of light stuff, would not hang jeans) so I can keep pants with pants instead of them getting lost falling into other clothes. I like the refined finish of the wood, the mahogany colour and the non-slip lining on the rod which helps to keep the pants on. I am happy to see it uses screws vs stoppers which if you look at other such types seems like they cut corners as could have easily used a screw type since the thread is already there.<br /><br />Dislikes<br />I wish it had something that stopped pants from slipping off horizontally. It would give the pants a better grip. Nothing has slipped per say but would be a good add on.<br />I am doubtful about the hanger head sustaining weight given its a small screw that ultimately holds it and only digs into the wood panel on the other side ever so minimally. Seems asking too much of that little guy. I think a long screw passing right through with a bolt on the other end would be better.<br /><br />This delivers 80% on visibility, 80% on organization and 20% on space.

You can't push down really good without you item slurping off in some random direction.  Very little control.  Too bad, because these are freakin' adorbs.

Even now the item is listed as 36.3"" tall in a picture and as 39.37"" tall and wide in the item details but it is neither!  This petite piece is a diminutive 36"" tall and 31"" wide.  It's so much smaller than anticipated (it was promised to be 46"" tall when I ordered it!) that it is useless for its intended purpose.  You could keep baby clothes in here, or maybe your socks, that's about it as far it being a clothes dresser.

4,The Power of Hairclips,"These looked very sturdy in the photos.  They are made of medium weight black plastic, and I don't think they are super sturdy, just a little sturdy. They get a C+ in sturdiness. I just needed these to hang bike helmets and other light gear in the garage in a specific place, so they work for me.  There's a snapping lever so your stuff is much less likely to get smacked off the hook.  I wanted that since this area of our garage gets a lot of foot traffic and items are hung close together. The clips on these though are the same strength and design of some of my hairclips.  Luckily I am using them and they're just right for what I need but don't go mooring your sailboat to one of these.  Don't take them mountain climbing.  Don't grab for this hook if a sinkhole suddenly opens up beneath you. Don't try to throw one at a bear to knock it out. Don't tether your stallion to one and don't tie a kite to it in a tornado.  Just use it to hang up one bike helmet at a time and you'll be good.",1677386664258,0,false

If I could make one change to it, the compartments above the cups would be deeper.  This is because a full tube of toothpaste will fall over in it once it's partially empty and isn't balanced anymore.  This would probably be worse if we didn't use all flat-top tubes of toothpaste.  We're one of those families where everyone has their own type/brand and we pile them into this thing.",1676838717697,0,false
4,"Mmm, Infrared","I keep thinking this think is E.T. waddling by in my living room.  For real though, this little dude puts out a lot of heat.  I docked star because it is kind of short and I wish the base were a tad heavier/wider.  The height isn't adjustable unless you decide not to use every twist-in rod.  It does have a shut-off feature that is serious about safety- jiggle this guy even a little and it shuts off immediately.  Even though it's short and I keep thinking this is an alien it really heats up my partner's workshop.  It's about 200 square feet of unheated artistic endeavor and its floor is not insulated, so he has to use heaters in there.  This little thing oscillates pretty wide and on high heat it has things warmed in a jiffy.  It's a more satisfying heat because of the infrared, not just a gust of warm air that fizzles in the cold.  It heats your bones! I also used this on low to help warm up my pet birds who escaped in the February cold but then, luckily, we were able to get back.  They were all puffed up in the heat beam, and I could tell they were getting warmed all the way through and appreciated it.  While this is stubby it is the exact height to beam its hot smile on my sitting on my couch, basking like a lizard.",1676574184372,3,false
3,Stinks Like Turpentine,"This odor is not going away.  It's is strong, sharp, offensive and alarming.  This has multiple slots of different sizes for different kinds of cords, which is nice.  But honestly I think the issue with most of these after-market cord wrappers is that they need to be longer.  If you have a longer cord on a larger item, say your stand-mixer, it's a bit difficult to wrap the cord as it quickly outpaces the cord holder in width, then the plug is so close to the holder it's hard to stuff in a slot. I do like this item and that I got so many and I have put them on several smaller appliances that should have come with a cord solution but didn't.  But that smell is just so strong.  Every time I get out my mixer I catch a whiff and it's been 3 months.",1676432784970,0,false
4,Keep the Directions,"OK, I'm really liking this little pot.  I use it in the evenings and set up breakfast for my kids so they have something hot and whole grain in the mornings all ready to go.  It's very cute and it's medium small- I can fit 4 cups of water and a cup of whole grain groats in this- even though it looks like it's not going to hold that much.  Steel cut oats and groats and quinoa take a long time to cook, so I would have to get up way early to start them, but it has a timer (directions call it ""appointment"") so I can prep the night before.  It's piping hot when they are ready to eat.  It really is non-stick too, even though I've overcooked my first batches getting the hang of this it it's been easy to clean and I didn't burn anything.<br /><br />My one issue is the directions.  They are translated ok if you're good with English,  but keep them because I was referring back to them multiple times.  It's confusing at first because minimal info is given but if you keep tinkering it's all in there, just possibly with strange wording.<br /><br />This cute little pot has a steamer basket too which is great, we love our humbao and bean buns and dumplings.  It can get really hot, it has a surprising amount of power, so I am still working on getting my recipes and timing just right.  As I get more confident with it I am going to try some other overnight dishes involving biscuits and eggs.  I also like that it has a keep warm function but again, it's all about getting to know the temperature settings because it can  really heat up quick.",1676187108089,0,false
2,Needs Improvement,"These are rechargeable, sitting on a tray that can be plugged in via USB.  So far we've gone several months on a single initial charge.  The grind can be adjusted in the usual way, meaning by tightening or loosening the crusher at the base where the spice comes out.  It has an LED light that I found surprisingly useful when I didn't think it was necessary at first.  These work fine, I do have a couple of issues with it, which is why I gave it only the 2-star rating.<br /><br />Firstly, they have small spice compartments of only a couple tablespoons.  You will be refilling them often and have to lay them on their side to refill.<br /><br />Secondly, there is only one small viewing window on one side of the grinder to show what you are grabbing.  When the contents are low, nothing is visible.  You can only see what you have through this small port window, which is also where the spice is loaded, unless you flip it over and check what's falling out the bottom.  It would be nice to be able to tell from any angle that I've just grabbed the pepper and not the salt.<br /><br />Thirdly, the charging tray is not helpful in display or storage, it is only for charging.  It doesn't catch any spilled spices and it doesn't create a. nice, decorative or stable place to store your grinders.  We keep it over on the counter because they just balance on top. The charger tray serves no purpose except charging when it could be so much more useful.<br /><br />Finally, this is the biggest issue of all:  They have poor balance.  They fall or get knocked over easily.  They are tall and narrow and not weighted to stay upright.  They fall off the charging base easily too, which again, doesn't hold them firmly.  I'm often just picking them up off their sides after dinner or when I go to wipe down the kitchen counters.  After using them to season, they are way to easy to tip over as you set them down again.  This is the biggest issue for us, we could dismiss the other issues as minor design oversights if not for this definite flaw.",1675133133252,0,false
4,Does what it says,"I got a big fat metal splinter in my finger from a shard on one of these hooks. My fingers also got all black just from putting it together, a super simple process.

I like the light green color and non-obnoxious leaf pattern and that I can see through all but 4 of the smaller pockets.  I haven't loaded it really heavy to test its strength much, but so far so good, none of the pockets have ripped.

I wouldn’t use it for heating a room since I’ve tried leaving it on for a bit and seeing if the garage is even a little warmer during winter and it isn’t. It’s really just for direct heat. The light setting isn’t that warm, so I prefer the high setting. The fan setting is pretty much useless. It’s good for the price and what I’m using it for though.",1676239434174,5,true
3,Disappointing,"I had an Oreck stick type steam cleaner that worked well on my floors for years.  When I remodeled my downstairs I specifically chose flooring that would stand up better to steam cleaning since I found this method worked better and was easier to use than any form of mop/detergent system I had ever used.  Immediately after installing my new floor my faithful Oreck died, and apparently Oreck is no longer making them.  I then researched and got what I thought would be not just a replacement but an upgrade, specifically one that would allow me to easily steam clean my shower stall, door handles etc. although my main interest remained cleaning my new porcelain tile floors.<br /><br />I've used it now a couple of times, and my husband also tried it out.  We are both disappointed.  The biggest issue is that we cannot get enough power out of the unit when using it to clean the floor.  The Oreck, which was a smaller unit, turned out more steam and so only took a couple of swipes to clean off a particularly soiled area.  This one requires multiple passes over a dirty spot, and particularly stubborn ones requires bending over and scrubbing at the spot by hand.  After a few swipes with steam the spot does come up fairly quickly by manual scrubbing but I'd prefer not needing to resort to this.<br /><br />I am pleased with the results on my shower stall and other above the floor applications.  There is enough steam power to blast away mildewed corners and to get dirt out of window edges and is easier to use in these applications than my Oreck had been but still...I'd like more power.<br /><br />My tile floor is slightly textured, perhaps if it were a smoother surface this would work better.",1673716134227,3,true
3,Works once,"These are a great product the first time they are used.  Unfortunately my experience has been that they cannot usually be used a second time.  This is particularly unfortunate if you are using these while traveling.  As a single use product I find these to be pricey even though they are very helpful for storing out of season clothing or packing for a vacation.  Blankets, comforters, sweaters, down jackets etc all shrink down to nearly nothing which greatly helps when storing, traveling or moving.<br /><br />I wish somebody would improve this product so it could be reliably used at least a few times.",1673195933363,0,false

4,cute nautical pillow cases,These are cute nautical pillow cases. Be aware that this set includes cases but no pillows. Each case has a hidden zipper along the bottom so it is easy to insert a pillow form. The designs are flat and printed on a loosely woven fabric that resembles burlap but is softer and more ecru than tan. I actually have stitched on some of the designs with embroidery floss to add texture and interest. I really like the way they look and feel now. These will look great in my sunroom as summer decor.,1677163744521,0,false
3,I like the idea,"I was excited to try these organizers out. There are a few reasons I do not give these a higher rating though. First off, they are maybe 1 inch too tall to fit into my dresser drawers. I think my wide dresser (the type with attached mirror and 3 sets of drawers) is a standard US furniture size. I don't understand why these don't fit! My assumption is that they are made to fit an Asian style dresser, perhaps? I decided that I could still use them on shelves in my closet. Unfortunately, the slots are so narrow that they won't fit jeans or sweaters. I can only use them for t-shirts.",1674226937653,0,false

But the machine does a decent job.  It's fairly heavy, so the battery may prove quite durable.

4,Confusing,"This review is for toothbrushes, but the listing is currently confused, describing both toothbrushes and whitening strips. I also can't factor price into my review as the item is currently unavailable.<br /><br />The other point of confusion was the charcoal bristles. I was confused how bristles could be charcoal and were even the white bristles charcoal somehow. I messaged the seller and was told, ""The bristles have nothing to do with the charcoal, the handle does. The bristles are normal."" Well, the handle is clearly bamboo, not charcoal, and the print on the box states, ""charcoal bristles"". Confusing.<br /><br />Those things aside, the toothbrushes are nice. They arrived unsealed but individually boxed, together in a box. The wood is nicely finished and smooth. The bristles are a bit harder than I think of as soft, but that's a good thing in my opinion since I prefer medium more. I get the feeling the bristles may fall out, and bamboo can mold. Dry them as well as you can to prolong they're life, but don't expect them to last as long as plastic toothbrushes.",1674773817154,0,false

For the most part, the Mecity electric kettle works as expected. It is easy to use. It is visually appealing when left out so I don't feel the need to put away like I do with my other kettle.

The size of the rack and that it can folded when not in use just adds to the convenience. We don't have a big household so that may be another factor in why it works so well for us.

2,Not So Smart - No 5GHz Wifi Compatibility,"For the price this is definitely ok.<br /><br />The noise it makes is not annoying. It is kind of a humming noise. However with that being said if vacuuming a room in the front of the house we can hear it in the farthest room in the back of the house.  So not something to try to run at night when sleeping.<br /><br />Also it's not the sharpest tool in the shed. It seems to be drawn to obstacles and it will vacuum over and over again around these obstacles like chair legs or table legs while vacuuming the wide open spaces maybe once.<br /><br />Also still can't get it hooked up to the wifi so we can use the app.<br /><br />Also we used a room divider to create a small simple area for it to vacuum and put the docking station in this area. It doesn't get stuff in the corners. But it just keeps vacuuming, we will see how long it goes and if it stops. So it looks like regardless of how big or small it will just keep vacuuming for the same length of time.<br /><br />Floors can't have electrical cords in its way they have to be off the floor for sure.<br /><br />Definitely put in each room and close the door and let it go. Use a stable room divider or something else if you want it vacuum a specific area.<br /><br />We paid $88 for it.  Saw it went up to $99.<br /><br />In our opinion this is a good robot vacuum if you don't have a lot of money or have never had one and want to try one out.<br /><br />But if money is no obstacle definitely get the smartest one you can afford and is 5GHz compatible.

2,"Massive ,poorly executed wall unit of unknown longevity","You have a bunch of metal pipes, poor quality woven type of material that reminds me of the packing cloths that are in some boxes now, it's not canvas as I would have assumed and would have made this product a whole lot better. The connectors are plastic joints and elbows which can become confusing and frustrating when assembling even to the most experienced in assembling furniture.  The instructions are not helpful, they are a guide but you have to figure it out as you go.<br />Make sure you are in the space you intend on this item to be because its not easy to move and will come apart.  It's massive and takes up a wall unit worth of space and is as deep if not deeper.<br />The cloth that provide for the shelving becomes bunched and you really have to work on slipping it over the large metal pipes and then manage to attach everything evenly that is if you have chosen wisely the correct plastic joints, or you will be re doing this again.  The cloth is a real issue, as you observe the sleeve as it is sewn you will note small holes that border the seam, it's bound to give way after clothing and weight being piled up on it overtime.  The good news is if you do really like the item I would have a pattern made of the cloth pieces and buy canvas and sew or have a knowledgeable person sew some replacements for the longevity of this.  The construction just seems really large and not fully usable for the size.

4,"Not ""Flannel"" but works fine. Seller is iffy.","These things are such a fire hazard I was pleased to find a trusted name like Westinghouse.  Still, people need to be aware that the use instructions are very, very specific (don't lie on them, don't let them get folded and pinched).  I notice the people with overheating/fire situations aren't mentioning those instructions.<br /><br />It's weird that they say it's ""Flannel"".  Fortunately people can see in the photo, probably, that it's this ""minkee"" faux fur type blanket covering that's all the rage these days.  I wish it were flannel (cotton) rather than polyester (which is basically plastic) because it's much nicer to be warm without totally overheating or building up sweat.<br /><br />The cords and electricals and everything feel nice and sturdy, with a solid connect/disconnect port to allow the blanket to be washed.  I like the temp settings and time settings very much.  It does seem to heat inconsistently but perhaps this has to do with its safety sensors, combined with the way the body perceives heat.  Usually it does what I want: warms me up for a little while and then shuts off.  Since it is polyester I wouldn't feel comfortable running it all night but I'm ultra-cautious about fire hazards.<br /><br />I got an email that the shipment was delayed, which was bothersome and alarming, but it turned out someone was using the ""your shipment is delayed"" feature to solicit reviews.

2,Same price fewer accessories??,"Purchased 4 times:<br />1st Jun. '21 ($29.95) for offspring who loves it; 2nd time was a gift Dec. '21 ($29.95) - both came with press, filter holder, funnel, and filters<br /><br />3rd in Dec. '22 was gift that I didn't know was missing parts until I got one for me  in Jan. '23 ($39.99!) and knew to ask the recipient. These latest purchases were higher priced but missing the filter holder and funnel!!<br /><br />Apparently they've decided to sell those little items separately for $9.95 each!! Come on - they took out what they value as $19.90 but still charge *way* more for just the press now?! It would be fine with me if they left out the funnel (plastic waste that I don't use, but they should have lowered the price to reflect this) but the filter holder should never have been removed from the kit without lowering the price as well.<br /><br />Yes, it makes a good cup of coffee, but I really doubt I'll ever buy as a gift again.

2,"Bought 2 years ago - still works well, BUT...","I bought this kettle in December 2019 for a college kid and they were happy with it. They've since upgraded and I got this hand-me-down.<br /><br />It heats quickly, cleans easily and would be perfect *except* for the fact that it's a total absolute frustration to set the pot back on the holder *exactly* centered! I can't believe she dealt with that every morning! It's such a poor design that I've not run into with other kettles I've used which are either cone-type shape or have a bigger hole or something so if you get it in the vicinity of ""center"" it'll slide on and engage with ease. Not this one - you've got to hit it just right.<br /><br />It's just surprising the conscience effort needed instead of just plopping down the pot.

3,"""Large"" Is in the Mind of the (Selling) Beholder","My kitchen funnel broke. Ohhhh goodie...as with everything else that has served me well for years, nobody sells them anymore.<br /><br />So it's off to Amazon. Yes, I find a whole set of funnels. No, I do NOT need a set of funnels -- small, medium, and large. I need ONE plastic funnel, whose size I would normally think of as ""medium,"" for use in kitchen. But if anything better is on offer, I can't find it.<br /><br />Amazon duly sends three funnels, thank you dear Amazon. And...the ""large"" funnel is what I would call ""small,"" or maybe at best ""medium:"" in size. It will do, sort of, but for my purpose will be a PITA, requiring pour-and-wait after pour-and-wait after pour-and-wait to get the job done. Since I can't buy any funnel here in the 9th-largest city in the nation, presumably decently sized plastic kitchen funnels no longer exist.<br /><br />Ah, what a brave new world we live in!",1677251021159,1,true

2,Review by Allyson Ware,"I am extremely disappointed in this product. I have been using it for two days and one of the straps has already ripped off. It would be a great product if it was made better. But it is NOT worth the $20 that they have it advertised for. It fits across the bottom of the door we have it on very well, but with the strap not functional it is a pain in the butt to move it every time we need to use that door. Also, if we leave the house, it cannot do its job because you have to place it behind the door rather than it shut with the door. I had high hopes for it, but I am disappointed to say the least.",1673007637089,0,false
4,"Perfect for two people, cord a bit short.","What I don't like.<br /><br />*  The cord is a bit short.  Our cabinets are the standard 13""+ a bit over the counter top and when I open this press it will hit the cabinet bottom before fully opened.  If I slide the press close to the edge of the counter top so it will clear the cabinet when open, then the cord is too short to reach the plug on the backsplash.  The cord only needs to be about 4"" longer - Grrr.<br /><br />*  The grill top pivots freely - there is no arm to hold it parallel with the bottom.  This requires the sandwich to be placed in the exact center of the grill and to be filled evenly  or else the grill top will pivot and mush one side thinner than the other.<br /><br />*  The cord is a pain to store.  There is a provision on the bottom to wrap the cord but it is an anemic failure.<br /><br />What I like.<br /><br />*  The price is nice for what I get.  I have never used a sandwich press and wanted to try it out without committing to a large and expensive model.  This one is perfect for what I want and the value is strong.<br /><br />*  I love the size - this is just right for two people.  I can make a big sandwich and we share, or I can turn out two smaller sandwiches.  And it is easy to store.<br /><br />*  To store, it will stand on edge to reduce the footprint - I love it!<br /><br />*  Super easy to clean.  If something gooey like cheese burns on then it will come off with just a damp paper towel or wooden spatula, that much force is rarely needed.  Usually I just spray on my surface cleaner I use in the kitchen and then rinse that off under running hot water.  Then I heat the grill to dry it and when cool I put it away.<br /><br />*  The non-stick surface works great - even burnt cheese will come right off!<br /><br />*  Super easy operation.  Just plug it in to pre-heat.  Red light means the power is on.  Green light means it is up to temperature and ready to use.  No knobs or switches - just plug it in and un-plug it when done!<br /><br />Overall this is a win, a good value, and perfect size for the two of us.  The minor drawbacks are easy enough to deal with.",1676368634217,3,true
4,A beautiful candle,"This is what I'd call a luxury candle. It is as striking as it appears in photographs, so no issues there. It does have a nice crackle on ignition, and the scent is light and unobtrusive, it just doesn't smell enough like sandalwood to be marketed as a ""sandalwood"" candle. The wax blend has other scent notes that crowd the woody fragrances as well as the patchouli, which I wish were more prominent. The only thing keeping this object from a five-star review is a paucity of sandalwood. Otherwise, it's quite attractive and the container will go on until it breaks. Still looking for the ideal sandalwood candle.",1676250810507,5,true
4,Very Good Sandalwood Scent,"This candle has a lovely, authentic sandalwood scent at a proper olfactory volume, at least for me. I do believe from the aroma the maker has used authentic, quality oils which are not cheap (especially sandalwood) so that makes this candle a good purchase. Could it be better? As I mentioned in my review of the Patchouli candle, they burn evenly without pooling BUT you need to trim the wick and once this candle burns halfway down, you can't get your hand down inside to do so. I think they smell so good I'd like to burn them as far as I safely can, but if I can't trim the wick, that's not possible. You couldn't light them with a plain match, either. These candles would be an extraordinary value if the maker poured them into wider jars to admit the average adult hand for proper wick maintenance.  The inability to maintain the wicks keeps me from making additional purchases.",1675197894743,0,true
4,"Nice Candle, But Could Be Better ...","Overall, the Patchouli candle has a good scent. It's not overpowering, which I like. My apartment is on the small side, so this candle works well for me.  However, the wicks are almost impossible to trim once the candle burns halfway down because an adult hand (unless very petite) won't fit inside with a small pair of scissors. I purchased Patchouli and Sandalwood, both of which smelled like the genuine scent, which leads me to conclude the maker used authentic oils, which is a good thing. Compared to other soy candles, these are good values.  They would be perfect if the maker poured them into squatter jars for ease of wick trimming. If you're using plain matches to light them, you won't be able to do so after a point. I really don't like using electronic lighters, I prefer natural matches. They do burn evenly without pooling, which is another pro. I would like to see this company offer them in jars with a wider mouth to allow for proper wick care. If they did, I would give these five stars and invest in more of them.",1675197429060,0,true

4,Good product but..,"I bought the package that included inner and outer sleeves.<br />I had expected the outside liners to be as described—clear. But they have something on the inside that makes them translucent. I immediately, rechecked that PVC (PolyVinyl Chloride) wasn’t used to make them. It chemically breaks down and will ruin the album—physical record—that’s covered and those next to the PVC sleeved album.<br />These are Polyethylene. (Please no plastic lectures.)<br />The residue easily wipes out with a high fiber dusting cloth. I’m a bit OCD, so I changed cloths after whipping two out. I did a dozen. With my disability that’s a feat.<br />Today I did a baker’s dozen. I stop just before, that inner glow of happiness, which flares up at the sight of a sleeved album, goes out. Then it’s work not fun.<br />I’ve done 25 albums. First 12, have been sleeved a month. No problems. Outer sleeves remain as clear as the day I wiped them out.<br />I experienced NO ripping, tearing, or issues with fitting. In fact I have sleeved the following with ZERO problems:<br />U2 War (83) - gatefold cvr, 1 vinyl<br />Hendrix Electric Ladyland (79)-gatefold, 2 vnyl<br />The Who The Kids Are Alright (79)-Single cvr, 2 (cardboard sleeves) vinyl and promo material<br />Springsteen Born to Run (75) - gatefold, 1 vinyl<br /><br />The Kids are Alright and Electric Ladyland are the thickest sets whose inner and outer sleeves were replaced.<br />I repeat I had zero problems with the sleeves. NO corners have riped or torn. A few albums were even played later—so some sleeves got a little work out.<br />Reading about other reviewers, having some problems with the corners, I treated them like I do everything involving my vinyl—gently.<br />I am, by no means, saying a thing about anyone or how they do things. I’m simply stating my experience, and how another’s experience alerted me to potential problems.<br />Without hesitation, I would order this product again.",1674880320819,0,true

4,Works great,"I needed blackout blinds for my son’s nursery and these fit the bill. Overall, it’s a great deal and you get a lot, but it’s a bit tricky to get setup.<br /><br />First of all, if you’re looking for instructions or tips, they’re in the listing photos—they are not included in thr actual product. I didn’t realize this until I came back to review them and would’ve saved me some troubleshooting during setup. So be aware, haha.<br /><br />Everything comes packaged in a drawstring bag, nicely folded and compact. You receive the blackout material, adhesives, a tape measure, and the bag. Again, no instructions. The material is meant to be cut to fit the window, which is where the tape measure comes in handy. I actually used a yard stick I had on hand and it also made cutting the material easier. I just kind of winged it. Once I measured and cut out the material, I stuck down the adhesive dots on my window panes. I also stuck the other side of the adhesive right onto the dogs with the glue backing exposed and stuck the material down onto everything. This worked out well. Only thing that’s not perfect is that if you have windows with any kind of projections (as most do), it affects the seal. Overall, I got it nice and dark in the room, but some light does get in. I’m sure if you were really intentional you could seal it up better, but this is ,arrested as something to use when traveling, and I personally wouldn’t want to have to spend that much time on something like that.<br /><br />The nice thing is that everything fits back into the travel pouch and I had a lot of material left to use in other places whenever we travel. Overall, I think this is an easy solution if you need more darkness than your curtains can supply.

4,"Looks good, a little hard to use","This kettle is really pretty. I love the color and overall look it has. The temperature gauge is a nice touch. The main issue I have is that its a bit confusing to use. Mine didn't come with instructions that were very clear, so I opened it the wrong way and kept messing with the temperature gauge to figure out how to use it. It is glass on the inside, which is nice, and keeps the liquids free from touching the plastic on the outer areas. It does feel a little on the cheap side, though, just because the plastic feels that way and the lack of intuitive use. Overall, I think it's nice but it could use some improvements.",1672891312323,0,false

4,Add a star if you don’t mind attached water container,"These silicon mats are a good idea and have several useful applications. Not only do they keep your table clean, but they also offer a relatively slip proof surface for people who are doing painstaking work, or using some kind of art/craft knife. Not that I’ve gotten around to using art knives on this surface yet. But theoretically speaking, this mat seems to be just as good, probably better, than the slip proof surface I had already ordered and bought and now with that I didn’t. This mat comes equipped with an attached, collapsible water container presumably to use to rinse a paint brush. Or maybe it can be used for other reasons, as well. There are also built in “pans” to make up a palette for your choice of paints. These two features might come in handy if using these mats for younger children, for whom the adult would dole out some paint and water or a water container. I did find it strange that the water container does not detach in order to make emptying it out or refilling it easier?? But I suppose that the water container could also be used to house a plastic cup containing rinse water instead. I could easily see myself using this mat primarily to make my woodblock prints: both for carving the blocks, because it appears slip proof, and also when I ink up and pull the prints. The paint wells and the water containers might save room, ultimately. Another possible application could be to work with alcohol markers on paper…or any other paper and paint combo that might bleed through or get too wet. Best of all, besides quick and easy clean up is that you can fold up this mat, after decompressing the water container, into a very small parcel and stuff it in your bag or craft bag. It seems to be a good practical item to have around, especially if you have an artistic kid who wants to work with things like waterproof inks or other staining pigments.",1674408652126,0,false
4,"We use it daily, not so easy to clean, a tad pricey perhaps","Despite taking a star off here or there in this review of the rice cooker, let me just preface everything and say: we use it constantly. The “pros”: 1). VERY easy to operate. You place two of the enclosed measuring cups of rice into the removable double boiler type of pot, plus approximately two of the same measuring cups of water in, too. Plug it in, press “menu”, and we see the little “rice” menu option light up and blink, and it cooks you your rice. That’s it. You go do whatever it is you have to do, and the rice is ready in about 30 minutes. 2). Cooks rice perfectly and fragrantly without any need to stay by the stove. “Cons” 1). I don’t know how much automatic ricers go for typically, this is my first one. Like many Vine items: Seems a tad pricey? Do your research, and watch for sales. If you can get it on sale, I think it is a nice addition for anyones kitchen, dorm room, studio apartment, etc. 2). While the inside of the double boiler pot appears to have a Teflon type of film, it still is rather difficult to get clean from “rice glue”, same with the lid. We tend to soak it rather than scrub too hard. All these aside, we love it, and it’s good outweighs the bad, as it does free up the time needed to stand around and monitor the stove so you can do other things.",1673968654223,3,false

But actually this is a great low-static low-pitched burr grinder. I have owned two others; this is the quietest.  You wonder WHY they thought that dial was a good choice and why all the beeps? The bin for grounds is nicely low-static, MUCH better than the Cuisinart which was ALWAYS MESSY and whiney loud! Really folks, get one with a low-static bin!!! This one is supposed to have a self-cleaning internal brush and only time will tell if it really works. I chose this one because our previous one (Shardor)got clogged internally and we COULD NOT GET IT OPEN to clean out the stuck grounds.<br /><br />We have had this one a couple of months and cannot speak to its longevity.

Give it 100 days or so.<br /><br />This simply stopped working in the middle of making my main meal. As a gastroparesis sufferer, a blender is my single most important kitchen appliance. I spent HOURS researching which one to get, with a budget of $80.<br /><br />As if gastroparesis isn't depressing enough all by itself, it took less than four months for the blender to fail. I have been gentle and used only already-chipped iced and cut up fruits or frozen purees. I was doing nothing other than usual It was doing what was promised.<br /><br />And then today it simply quit working, mid-meal prep. It over-heated, stank, rattled, and stopped. Sure, it restarted after The Husband looked at it, let it cool, turned it on, and declared it fixed. Still sounds wrong, but what do I know? I'm just the one who uses it EVERY DAY? What do I know?<br /><br />It sounds like a whirly-gig.<br /><br />I know it'll disappoint me again. At any moment, when it's doing the exact thing I bought it for. I'll get sucker punched a second time. The evils of good ad copy.<br /><br />I treated that thing with kid gloves, and it will eventually leave me unable to eat any real (if you call a semi-liquid diet ""real"") food until I buy another.<br /><br />Unfortunately, The Husband has spoken and I'm stuck with each meal taking just that much longer as I baby what is SUPPOSED to be a high-powered blender, trying to eek out another meal before I'm down to the shaker bottle. THEN I can get another blender. I'll go to Costco, where I can take it back if it's a lemon.<br /><br />Shaker bottle drinks just aren't worth it when it's all you can really 'eat.'

If I pull the plastic wrap down, I can cut it with the foil cutter but it will NOT cut with the broken slide.<br />In all, this is a nice box holder that I will continue to use.

4,No assembly instructions; good clear organizers,"This organizer set doesn’t come with assembly instructions. I figured it out by looking at the pictures, but I still think a sheet of instructions should come with it.<br /><br />Every single piece -- the shelves, the frames, the dividers, the baskets -- are wrapped in plastic. I appreciated that, as acrylic can get scratched.<br /><br />The dividers are optional. The drawers have defined slots for them, but if you don’t use the dividers, the slots aren’t in the way. The dividers wobble a little, but the slots keep them in place. The divider slots are approximately 2½ inches apart.<br /><br />Both hanging cups have holes in the bottom for drainage.<br /><br />The drawers slide smoothly in and out of the organizers, but if you have heavy items in the front and pull out the drawer, it does tip forward. There are no sliders or tracks, the drawers just sit in the frame.<br /><br />Minor quibbles aside, this 2 pack of organizers is a good value. They are small enough to fit under bathroom and kitchen sinks, but placement will depend on your plumbing.",1679003380850,0,false
3,"Instructions are terrible; tall, narrow shelving unit","The ZIGAMA 6-Tier Metal Organizer is a tall, slim storage unit. It comes with wheels or flat feet; I appreciated that, since I almost never use wheels on shelving units. The shelves aren’t too deep, but do provide a surprising amount of storage: I can fit eight 37oz bottles of laundry detergent on each one.<br /><br />The instructions are terrible. Putting the unit together isn’t that hard, but the instructions made the process more confusing than necessary. The instructions show a unit with 5 shelves, not 6 shelves, so at first I couldn’t figure out the proper order for the side pipes (or pillars, as they are called in the instructions). There are 4 pipes with closed plastic tops on one end, those go on the top. There are 4 pipes with a screw hole to attach the wheels or flat feet, those go on the bottom. Then 3 interchangeable pipes go in-between. The instructions don’t make a distinction on the different types of side pieces.<br /><br />The shelves are smooth and didn’t have rough edges, but I did have a lot of black paint or metal flakes on the floor after I finished putting the unit together. I did notice some scratches or rough edges on the side pipes. The tools include a tiny pair of gloves; I have small hands and they barely fit me.<br /><br />Construction and assembly woes aside, the unit is a good choice for small spaces. It’s about 6 feet tall; I actually ended up removing the top shelf because it’s so tall I could barely reach the very top.",1678317102086,0,false
4,Really work,"I’ll admit, I thought snack chopsticks were silly … until I tried them. Now I’m a convert!<br /><br />I use a set every night for easy, clean snacking while I’m working on my laptop. The chopsticks really do keep your fingers (and computer) clean!<br /><br />My hands are on the smaller side, so it’s not comfortable for me to use the chopsticks as pictured, and by that, I mean I can’t leave them on while I type or play on my Switch. So I use them like a set of mini tongs, and they work well that way, too.<br /><br />I have the “6-Lover” pack, which has 6 pairs of chopsticks: 2 blue, 2 green, and 2 pink. I’ve put them in the dishwasher several times, they still look brand new. No signs of wear. The chopsticks are all smooth, no rough edges or sharp plastic spots.",1677104494207,0,false
4,"Fit inside 2QT, dishwasher safe","These tie dye silicone air fryer liners will fit in a 2QT air fryer basket. I use them with my 2QT Instant Air Vortex. I didn’t even have to cut the removal handles off.<br /><br />If you haven’t tried a silicone liner before, it makes a HUGE difference in clean up after using the air fryer. Before I had to handwash the grate and basket, or I tried making a makeshift liner from aluminum foil. Handwashing is a pain, and the foil isn’t perfect, plus it’s wasteful.<br /><br />Silicone liners changed my air frying life -- they are dishwasher safe! I’m lazy, so seriously, these are great. I cook a turkey burger every night, and they make a scrummy mess with all the fat runoff. The silicone liner catches all of it, I put the liner in the dishwasher, and boom, clean up is done.<br /><br />The only thing I don’t like about these tie dye liners, they don’t have a lot of raised cutouts on the bottom. The pie-shaped indentation doesn’t seem to work quite as well for grease runoff as a liner with lots of wavy lines or the like. But that didn’t impact cooking time or temperature.",1676587249556,0,false
4,Non-slip hangers,"Velvet hangers are great! They really are non-slip. So non-slip I actually had trouble getting my shirts on the hangers, but that’s good, because it means my clothes won’t slide off like with plastic hangers.<br /><br />The hangers are slim, so they also take up less space than plastic hangers.<br /><br />These hangers from Ulimart are a bit flimsy. The description says one hanger can hold up to 12 pounds of weight, but the hanger would snap if I tried that. Tees, hoodies, a coat, one pair of jeans, all of those are okay. But doubling up on jeans, or a very heavy coat, I’d use two hangers or a plastic one.",1672777496248,0,false
4,Useful to wash a variety of small items,"The A Bar Above Dishwasher Basket is one of those little handy things you don’t know you need until you use it.<br /><br />I use the basket for my silicone pinch bowls. They are small and usually fall through the top rack to land on the bottom of the dishwasher. I’ve also used it with coffee scoops, small measuring spoons, and small reusable coffee pods.<br /><br />I do not use it with reusable straws because most of my straws are too long to stand upright on the top rack.<br /><br />I do wish the basket had some sort of loop or fastener on the outside to help keep it secured inside the dishwasher. Sometimes I can position it so the prongs help hold it.<br /><br />I’ve used it about 10 times so far, and it shows no signs of wear.",1672688835619,0,false

I was hoping that the bamboo lid would keep heat from escaping.<br />It does, but that constant moisture from the condensation is already making the bamboo split.<br />In addition, there are two mugs and two lids, but only one spoon. I wish this set had included two spoons since the lids accommodate for a spoon.<br />It’s a very cute, vintage, look, and the mugs are generously sized so that oatmeal or soup, as well as beverages, can be served in them.",1678477474684,0,false

When I clean the countertop, I will often put things like this in the cleaned sink, and then replace after the surfaces are also clean.<br />I was surprised that scratches appeared after doing that.

But no doubt about it, the flavors are bold.  Each is unique and all are great on sandwiches.<br />All three arrived sealed. The lids were not popped up indicating that the seal had been broken. But what worries me is that you can clearly smell the pickles if you put your nose to the lid.

Quite a bit actually. I was hoping to be able to use less oil, but I guess that won’t be possible.<br /><br />Having said that, this has a visually stunning, functional design. The surface is beautifully patterned and cooks evenly across most of the bottom half, assisted by compromising between a round bottom traditional wok design and a more pan-like shape. In other words, it has a flat section that gently rounds, so you have more surface area touching your heat element. This makes it more useful for flat ranges and gives it wider applications, and I appreciate that. Also has a vented lid, which is great.<br /><br />Overall: good, but not nonstick.",1677412094138,0,false
3,"Not worth the money: doesn’t have an attractive finish, isn’t soft","I’ve ordered a variety of sheets, both expensive and cheap, but these are definitely not worth the $99 price tag they currently have. Not only does it not have an attractive sateen finish, but it’s not even soft on your skin. They don’t look great, and they don’t feel great, so at least I hope they last a long time and are durable, which from the first wash, it appears may be the case (the one positive thing that gives this 3 stars rather than 2). Overall, these aren’t worth the price. I’ve seen better for less, and much better for this price.",1676829407883,0,false

4,Works with most but not all toothpaste tubes,"Bummer. I use Sensodyne as one of my main toothpaste brands, and their tip tapers in such a way that these don’t work so well :-( I’m using it anyway, but it does come off from time to time. On all my other toothpaste tubes, it works perfectly though! You do have to squeeze a little harder to get it to come out, but it seems a fair trade off for not dealing with the lid all the time.<br />Works fine with most (but not all) toothpaste tubes—the standard kind. Great concept and execution—just make sure your preferred toothpaste brand uses a standard style tip (cylindrical without a taper).",1674071563830,0,false
3,"Terrible instructions, ugly, works ok","EDIT: after several attempts, I got this to stay on fine, and it has stopped slipping down; thus, I added one more star to the review. The original review is below.<br /><br />I don’t really recommend this product, and I’m almost considering putting my old rusted tension rod back in place. It looked better and stayed on better as well. Not only are the instructions absolutely the worst, rendering them useless, but it just doesn’t stay in place very well. It looks like they had the intentions or idea of some sort of suction cups at the rubbery ends, but realistically, they are not that. They just *look* like that. They don’t actually stay on very well. The tension spring works OK, so at least there’s that. It’s just that without the ends being very effective, I can tell you this is already fallen down once.  As for the appearance, you have to put the side with all the holes facing down if you want the curtain to slide along the rail. It’s visible, and it’s ugly. I also think it’s going to hold moisture and cause corrosion on the inside in a relatively short time. That may or may not be an issue down the line, but I can imagine that if the spring starts to rust, it will slowly lose structural integrity and snap at some point. Also, the rod is so thick, many accessories to hold your curtain won’t work. I have gone through two types, and they’re both not so compatible with this rod, and they won’t really slide, so I might have to go an buy something else, which is additionally vexing. Not a great product. Just OK.",1673209145409,0,false
4,"Not enough safety features, but still fine","This does what it’s supposed to do, but it doesn’t have any additional safety features beyond turning off after 8 hours.

4,Makes a good office gift,"[[VIDEOID:7be52aebdc83c87acd7f75b8099bc79b]] At the current price of $31.99, this is a decent value for an easy and ready-to-gift box of birthday goodies. This gift box may lack the personal touch, but it’s a perfect office gift, and the packaging is pretty nice (though certainly not the best I’ve seen). The items inside aren’t as fragrant as I expected, but what a lacks and quality it makes up for in quantity and convenience. Overall, I do not recommend this gift for a loved one or someone close. It’s not quite impressive enough in the presentation or quality, and it can come across as impersonal. It is, however, a great value for colleagues or neighbors, and the like— just remember to fill out the card if you’re not sending it directly! I took a little video of the items inside, as well as making a photo collage, that way you can see what arrives for a regular everyday buyer.",1672834220422,0,false
4,Attractive but impractical gift,"These glasses are lovely, as are the rhinestones and circling the bottom portion. Everything is beautifully packaged, with tongs for the metallic freezable cubes, sturdy coasters, and a gorgeous magnetic gift box and bag to put everything inside. The main downside is the fact that these are hard to clean, regardless of the claim that they’re not. Sure, as long as you clean them right after and only use them for cold, clear liquids (water, soda, alcohol), they should probably be fine, but what about the parts between the rhinestone chains that show on the inside of the cup? Will those corrode over time or accumulate stuff and then look yucky inside the cup? No idea. Only time will tell. But for now, everything does, in fact, look terrific, and since I can only review what I can see, not what I think *might* potentially happen if this was not fully sealed around the rhinestone chain, this gets 5 stars.",1672768978314,0,false

4,Nice but a little Small,"This is a nice, soft electric blanket. But there's no way it's a 50x60. It's pretty small. I'm 5’4 and it barely covers just my legs. It's good for just watching tv on the sofa though. And I like that I can't feel the wires too much. It's very soft and light not all heavy. It gets about medium-quality heat to its max it is nothing like a twin or full size. And it did great in the washer and dryer. It still looks brand new.",1673071553568,0,false
4,Easy to use,"Easy to use and clean. Comes well packaged with easy to understand directions. I normally would use a traditional kitchen scale, no batteries.

Readings were accurate and the same as my normal scale.",1678707665610,0,false

4,Love the Marble Base,"Once assembled this is a solid, nicely designed mug tree. Assembly is straightforward. The instructions consist of pictures. Not a fan; I prefer the written word. The marble base is heavy, stable and attractive. I got the gold version which looks chic. It does not rotate and is best for small to medium sized mugs. I put my espresso cups on top and the larger mugs/cups on the lower levels. It is a convenient space saver.",1677463219852,0,false
4,Convenient,This is a basic organizer. It is adequately made. Each pocket holds a single shoe. It can handle adult sizes which is good. It hangs securely. So far I am pleased with its performance.

4,Very Pretty,These curtains are super pretty. The fabric is lovely and the pattern pretty. They darken but are not one hundred percent black out. They are excellent at keeping cold air out. The grommet top insures easy installation. They look beautiful when hung.,1675831256220,0,false
4,Coffee Worth the Cons,I am a bean fiend and this coffee maker can take beans (or ground coffee) and make a great cup. It is not the easiest to use.

4,Removable Plates,"What I like best about this appliance is the versatility. There are three removable plates for waffles, sandwiches and grilling. The plates are non stick.

4,"Good Fan,Bad Instructions",Once assembled this fan is great. The gold looks chic. It has an ac adaptor and a solar panel. The fan can be used indoors and out.

But the fan looks great and works reliably.,1674285033127,0,false

4,Basic But Good,"I am a,big fan of atomic clocks. This one is basic but good. It includes a weather station. It is large and easy to set up. The syncing is slow but it eventually occurs. The screen is easy to read. Features are limited however. There is no backlight and adjustment controls are on the back. You have to move it around to get a solid signal. But it works and serves the purpose.",1674244527576,0,false

4,Different,This is a cute deviation from the traditional Valentine's Day hearts. It is metal with a little sparkle. Mine did not come with the twine to hang it with. It can be used indoors or out. A bit smaller than I anticipated but cute.,1674061544326,0,false
4,"Heat In, Light Out",These curtains keep out light and keep in warmth. I put them in a back bedroom that gets chilly. They were easy to hang. I can't say I love he look. They are not as rich and luxurious as I anticipated. But they do the job and are nicely made.,1674029376515,0,false

4,Beats a Corkscrew,This tool looks sleek and sophisticated. More importantly it is easy to use and does the job well. It requires batteries which are not included. That is one of my pet peeves. In any event the foil cutter works but the stopper is a throw away. I first opened a bottle of Malbec and it did not fit. Didn't do it with a bottle of merlot or chardonnay. Otherwise a great tool that is easier than a manual corkscrew.,1673252489234,0,false
4,Task Master,"I am a big fan of the Pomodoro method, where you tackle a task for a specified period of time, take a break and resume the chores. This clock makes it easy to do.

Good for multiple applications including studying, exercise and meditation.Triple a batteries are included.",1672640444197,0,false
4,Very Good,"This is a terrific steamer. Compact it is easy to use. It heats quickly and does not spit or spill. The tank, of course, is small, making it better for touch ups. I have it in my office. I am in a profession where suits are the uniform. Jackets get wrinkled and this keeps them looking fresh and crisp. The cord is 36 inches, and a bit stiff. But a great tool for travel or touch ups at home or at work.",1672640108842,0,false
4,Keeps Things Fresh.,"My biggest complaint with this is that it needs a handle to move it around. I'm using it to store birdseed, thus it does not sit on my countertop. The handle shown in the picture is part of the airtight system and can't be used to lift and carry the container; full or not. I suggest a harness accessory that slips on up to the collar with a bridge handle to relocate the container as needed. Otherwise, this is a well made, sturdy container that keeps seeds, nuts, or grains fresh and free from insects and rodents. I can recommend this product.",1674262370840,1,true
3,Not very sturdy.,"Instead of hard covers front and back, the outer jacket is a malliable clear plastic. What should be the outer covers are some kind of card stock. The section dividers are flimsy plastic and if they dry out and stiffen with time, I can see them tearing easily. The recipe pages are double-sided. It would be better if the back side was just lined for notes, like where to buy certain kitchen tools or ingredients, or personal variations on that recipe. The ""pocket page"" at the back is just a sheet of paper with a half sheet of construction paper affixed; not sturdy in the least. It comes with a quarter sheet of skimpy peel-off labels, but there are no blanks for anything you might individually need. All in all, this isn't what I would call a quality offering. It's thin plastics and sheet paper in toto. This could be a nice offering, but it needs a lot of upgrading. And I would be embarrassed to give such a flimsy offering as a gift. One can definitely do better elsewhere.",1674261838011,0,true

4,Great small heater. Heats a good size room,"This is a great little heater. It puts out heat quickly and when it reaches the temp desired by the thermostat setting, it shuts off. Not just the heat, but the fan also. There is a ""fan only"" setting but you must turn the thermostat slightly to have it begin blowing unheated air. The tilt/angle part is a bolt on either side, to me it could be a bit better design but it works. That is the only reason I didn't give 5 stars.",1674152169056,0,true

You get what you pay for, but they were not cushioned in the box. They were just in a box, alone, no bubble pack, thus when it traveled and then tossed over my fence they broke.

4,It’s ok.,"I have a powered Shark and I love it. This cordless model is ok. I don’t get the hype with these cordless vacuums…<br />It does pick up ok on the Med speed but I find  it misses some stuff that my powered Shark would not. I find I have to use the high power to get it to pick it up (and that drains the battery VERY fast). I don’t like the feel off the vacuum. It doesn’t run smoothly (I suspect it’s the fins underneath causing this). I have to make sure to vacuum in certain directions to get the vacuum to work best. Also after vacuuming my carpet, it just doesn’t look vacuumed. I am used to seeing vacuum lines in my carpet and there is none. Those lines imo meant the suction was good. I NEVER see  vacuum lines after using this cordless vacuum. It does pick up stuff because I do have to empty the bin- but I just don’t think these cordless vacuums do as good a job as a plug in vacuum. It’s a shame as I like the portability, the lightness and compactness of the vacuum.  I think it would work better on tile/wood floors.<br />Now let’s talk about the battery charge… a HUGE selling point for me was the addition of a second battery and the ability to remove it to charge. I would NEVER recommend anyone not having a second battery when purchasing ANY cordless vacuum. The battery runs out pretty quick esp if you use the highest power setting. That setting really should only be used once in a while as it drains the battery VERY quickly. I use the med setting only (low setting is a waste of time imo) and occasionally the high. I use a battery and a 1/2 for about 1200 Sq foot. If I only had 1 battery I would have to wait 2-3 hours for it to recharge to finish my home.<br />The things I like about this vacuum was the attachments, extra battery, method of charging and how compact it is. I also like that I can vacuum under my couch because of how compact it is. This vacuum can also be used as a hand held- because of the attachments it can be used to vacuum ur car  (if you live where there is no power outlet access, like and apartment, this will be great).<br />The thing I don’t like is that it doesn’t stand up on its own when the battery is on which can be annoying. I kept the vacuum but will still hang on to my powered vacuum. I was really hoping to replace my larger plug in vacuum with this. Just one more thing to take up space….",1673674664216,9,true

First use and they are worn down. I immediately sent a message to the seller and have yet to receive a response.<br /><br />Day 2 - using the second cup and second blades, again blending frozen fruit and almond milk, this time there was no burning smell, but the blender took longer to chop the fruit, so long that my arm started hurting from pressing down on the cup for so long.<br /><br />I'm not impressed with this blender one bit The cups are half the size of Ninja cups..<br />I've been a loyal user of more expensive Ninja IQ blenders for the past decade, but those motors run out after a year.

I needed this to lightly buff a hardwood floor that had a bit of wax build up, I ended up having to do it plank by plank by hand.<br />This machine should be called something like “Barbie plays cleaning”, although I think Ken’s tiny doll car is heavier than this.<br />The brush attachments are a little nicer and kind of fun to clean the floor with that but still not heavy duty and definitely not worth the purchase.

4,Look and feel cheap,"I really wanted to love this set so I could replace my many years old previous set that came in its own block in much the same way for about the same price.  The block itself is gorgeous and probably the best thing about the whole set.  The knife blades are decent enough and get the job done, but the handles just look and feel really cheap.  They're very light almost to the point they feel hollow and they do not feel like they would hold up to being used by my husband who is a professional cook.  He wants nothing to do with this set at all, just keeps going back to his 'good' knives and working on sharpening our older ones when he has the time.  This set didn't even manage to claim a place for itself on our counter.  It was basically rejected and stashed away in the pantry.  The handles are just way too light and cheap feeling in your hand.  Even I can tell that much and I'm not the type to be picky about that sort of thing.  I'm still using the same knife block set I bought when we first moved into this place eighteen years ago.  Everything about the handles on these just looks and feels wrong to me.  The plastic is actually a bit slippy, so even with the indented design I wouldn't feel comfortable trying to hold and use them with anything less than perfectly clean and very dry hands.",1677347190976,0,false
4,Very thin and flimsy,"You absolutely need a cookie sheet to place underneath these and you need to have it available while you are filling them because trying to move them even just a short distance across a level surface while full is extremely awkward.  Of course that's only an issue if you're making a lot and don't have enough small cookie sheets to put underneath them.  I did lower the baking temperature too, simply because I'm not sure that I trust these at higher temperatures.  They really are very thin and flimsy.  My husband did have an idea that was fun though.  Using them as ice trays, especially if freezing something colorful like flavored drink mixes, creates cute little swim ring floats.  Can add fruit and such as well to give them even more character.  Would be a lot of fun for a pool party or beach themed party, I think.  Added bonus, you can drop a straw right down through the hole and it will be kept standing mostly upright.  You definitely still need something to put underneath them for moving around, but for that purpose I've found that cooling racks work perfectly.  Mine can even be stacked on top of each other with plenty of room for circulation to help them freeze faster.",1676826092545,1,false
4,"Just okay, seems prone to leaking and the top is too tight","I really wanted to love this blender and for the most part I'm content with it, but I wouldn't go so far as to say I'm actually happy with it.  The bottom of the blending jar seems to be prone to a bit of leaking, especially for something very thin like water.  Didn't have any problems with it leaking while making a milkshake though.  It's a lot more quiet than our previous blender but I'd say it's about even power-wise.  It does a good enough job for our needs.  My biggest issues with it would have to be the leaking and the fact that the top cover is just way too tight to pull it off without a fight.  As in I have to hug the jar against me and really work at it to get it off, hopefully without making a mess in the process.  I do like the fact that the entire unit is much lighter in weight than my previous one, so pulling it out and putting it away are not difficult.  I do like that it will not turn on unless the jar is locked in place.  The slight leaking only seems to be an issue with very thin, watery sorts of things, but the tightness of the cover is always an issue.  For the price I honestly expected it to be about even with the very old, basic, no frills $30 blender it was meant to replace and in power it doesn't disappoint.  It's got some other issues though, and cleaning it is not quite as easy as my previous one was either.  I don't hate it, but I also don't tend to use the blender very often.  If I used it daily I'd probably be looking for a different one already because the tight cover issue would get really old really fast.",1676565103600,1,false
4,The very end of the handle is weak and floppy,"First of all let me say that we really do love these little things.  The spatula part is perfect and I think the value for the money is most definitely there since it's a set of five.  Where it comes up short, quite literally, is the end of the handle.  You can feel where the metal support inside it just abruptly ends and it is not actually at the end.  I don't personally see a need for hanging loops on something this small, so to me that's just a waste of potential handle reinforcement space.  The floppy end feels weird in your hand and you automatically shift your hold down to compensate for that shortcoming, which in turn shortens the useable length of an already very short tool even more.  We do use them and we do love them, but every single time we do we find ourselves cursing that floppy end part all over again because it just ruins an otherwise perfect little spatula.  Remove the hole at the end of the handle and extend the metal support to the end instead and this is a solid five stars.  The fact they are seamless means no worrying about any nastiness hiding away in crevices and they are an absolute dream to clean up whether you're tossing them into the dishwasher or washing by hand, which is so quick and easy with these that I find myself favoring it.  The floppy end on the handle isn't a deal-breaker by any means, but it is an annoyance and I do find myself getting annoyed by it every time I use one, probably because it's otherwise such a perfectly handy little thing and you can't imagine how something like that could have been overlooked or ignored in the first place.",1673720544970,3,false
4,Has a few quirks that make me want to return it,"The biggest quirk I don't like is that when it reaches temperature, the heating element turns off but the fan stays on so now it's actively cooling the room instead of heating it.

4,Decent Chair Mat,"This chair mat is actually quite thick and sturdy.  It's made for low pile carpet, which is what we have but the only reason I gave it a 4-star is because it doesn't always stay in place.  With the pokey grippers on the bottom, there really is no reason this mat shouldn't stay where you put it until you need to move it, and I don't have to put it back very often, but I never should have to put it back at all.  When you first get it, because of the material and thickness, it will take some time to get it to lay flat, so be patient with that process.  Once it has been used for a week or two, it is completely flat and my chair rolls smooth on it, but doesn't slide because of the texture on top, which is a bonus.  I don't want my chair moving until I move it.  I bought this to make sure it protects the carpet underneath, I am up and down from my desk all day long every day and the constant rolling of the chair would definitely ruin my carpet if I didn't have a protective mat like this underneath.

It is now running in a safe area overnight to see if I clogged up all the leaks. Don't waste your money it is not worth it.

All,in all happy to hang them up as decorations and they are a solid value",1678674894424,0,false

4,Crude and Clunky But Works OK,This humidifier has a large tank so it will last quite awhile before you refill it. It also has a light option which I rarely use as I turn this on at night and any kind of light will make it hard for me to sleep. Fortunately it does work quietly (no dripping noises) and it keeps the air moist and I can tell the difference when I wake up in the morning.<br /><br />There's also a tray that you can eject -you can add essential oil but I rarely do as it leaves a greasy residue which you have to clean later.<br /><br />What it lacks in design (I find it rather plain looking and a little bulky) it makes up for in holding a lot of water so you don't have to keep refilling it. But I like humidifiers that are smaller and go better with my decor.,1673461946281,0,false

4,fun new kitchen item,"Takes careful reading of sntructions, and it didn't really froth at all the first 2 tries, need a very quick finger on the push button on the side of the pot to get just the setting you want, but after a week's use, I've discovered that the warm milk is nice but doesn't make the milk as warm as you might want for your ""hot chocolate"" but gets very nice for adding to the cup of coffee. Whole milk works well, but don't put in the maximum amount-just past the mid-point seems the optimum level for both heating and frothing. Instructions say it doesn't go over 65 Celsius, which I haven't corroborated. Do not but anything in the pot but the milk. It will stop automatically whether you like the amount of froth or not, so try out different levels of milk to get the best froth, otherwise you'll find there is lots more milk than froth left. Must wait 3 minutes at least after the first use if you want to go back to frothing otherwise it won't work. This is not a professional machine, so adjust your expectations, experimenting, keep adjusting amount of milk until you find the best level for your needs, and enjoy because after all it is fun. If we don't use all the milk during the first round, please toss the remainder even if you think you can use it later because, you know, food safety and all that plus you've used up the creamy part of the milk which is the fat part. Remember to rinse the pot and lid with warmest water you can stand after you finish the first round, carefully wiping it dry to remove all the residue. Nice touch is the additional whisk and frother and the silicone spatula that just fits the pot. I add a sprinkle of cinnamon, which you can find on this web site for the freshest herbs and spices. keep a little chocolate also on the side for fun touches. Too frothy actually for tea",1672942670935,1,true

We live in our 5th wheel full time and use the recliners daily. About a month ago, my back started to hurt and shoulders were cramping. Realized it was from the recliners. The padding has compressed to the point that the chair's skeleton can be felt and there is no support for the back and low body. I have purchased different lumbar supports, but they don't seem to help. I have been sitting in the kitchen chair more often. Going recliner shopping to find better options for us.

4,So much to love - but not perfect,"This tea kettle is really beautiful. I love the color.<br />The first thing I noticed is that my lid handle is almost bent looking, for the price, I would have expected a neater finish.<br />The tea kettle has a lot more needs then I expected. The interior is coated, making it less likely to rust. There is just a slight area around the lid and the opening of the pot where the lid sits that is uncoated cast iron that is prone to rust with out maintenance.<br />The other thing I noticed right away about the lid is that it doesn't have a little hook/extension so that it ""locks"" in place while pouring. The lid will fall off if pouring without bracing it.<br />The included tea basket is really a nice touch. It fits well into the kettle.<br />I was surprised to see the instructions where certain teas would ruin the finish of the kettle and could not be brewed in the pot.<br />The kettle is not as heavy as I would have expected, even full of water.<br />The kettle does an amazing job at keeping water warm after boiled.<br />This tea kettle does not whistle.<br />Overall a beautiful kettle that I can use on my glass top stove and will keep my tea/water warm!",1678668986586,0,false

A disappointment. It also states dishwasher safe but if you purchase don’t put it in the dishwasher. The sheet comes out looking worse. After only a few times using it in my oven scratches easily formed on the bottom of the sheet & my oven is new so my racks aren’t ones which would cause such scratches.

3,Nice but not sanitary & doesn’t keep water cold beyond 10 hours,"I purchased this water bottle as I wanted a new bottle for the gym & then fill it for my day of work. This is a nice water bottle. It’s well made & of good quality. Upon receiving I realized the top, which has 3 different ways to drink from it, doesn’t protect it from germs. I wouldn’t use the option of taking the top off to drink from it. The 2 other options present do not have protection from anything flying around in the air. I’d be drinking from the top with unknown germs from others at the gym. My picture of the 2 components that could be used. Neither have a cover to protect. Sure I didn’t look close enough at the drinking piece to see this upon purchasing but this isn’t sanitary. Even in using it at work. I work in a pharmacy where there is a lot of action from the staff & customers. Again, no protection at the top. I’d drink water along with a bottle of juice at work. Whatever water that was left at the end of the day was not cold. This doesn’t keep water cold as it’s described. The cost reflects the quality & this may work for some but with the stuff that’s in the air causing illness this bottle isn’t for me. I wish the top was made with some type of cover to protect where I’d be drinking from. So look at the pictures closely if you’re considering.",1677873027573,1,true

There wasn’t a flaw to the material or stitching. They laundered wonderfully on cold with a regular dry. There was very little wrinkle to them. They rolled up nicely for my purpose. These are made in Canada. My one issue is the material is NOT linen as described. The material is more of a polyester/ cotton. Hence, $23.99 I feel was overpriced since these were not linen.

I had to do some fluffing to full it out as much as I could to make it a pretty wreath to hang from my door. Not one twig or eucalyptus leaf fell or broke off in the packaging or during my process of fluffing. It is somewhat fragile so I’m careful in using it. My issue is it’s described as 12” & to the fullest extent I could fill it reached 9”. The inner hole is 5”. For as pretty as this is I do feel $20.99 is overpriced.

It’s cool to the touch on the sides while still putting out an enormous amount of heat that rises out the top and the wheels underneath it are retractable for easy storage.<br /><br />If you were thinking to use this unit to make sure that a small space in your house was a warmer temperature than the ambient temperature of the house when you got home the. this might or might not work depending on whether or not they have been any power outages or even just power fluctuations while you were away.<br /><br />If you’re planning on setting up this unit for the purposes of making sure your pipes don’t freeze while you were away from your house in the case that your primary heating system went off them this is completely unreliable..<br /><br />The only solution would be to buy a electronic physical button pusher that was Wi-Fi enabled that you could control while away from your house as well as a Wi-Fi enabled camera pointed right at the heater so that you could see if it was on or not.<br /><br />That way you could remotely turn the heater back on by physically pushing the power buttonwhile away from the house if there was a power outage.",1675599837966,3,true

Those are attributes that make it wonderful for delicate, decorative, fine paring or carving. It is simply not stout enough though to cut through a big apple or cut into something that’s fibrous or dense.  The knife even comes with a little pamphlet that warns you not to power your way through if the knife seems stuck…..just pull it straight out.  So….this is a beautiful, well crafted small and almost dangerously sharp knife for delicate and decorative jobs in the kitchen.  I use it regularly.  Oh, it is also beautiful.

My collection of eyeglasses include aviator-style frames, large ""dorky"" acetate frames and the like. The only pair of glasses that did not fit into a slot were my safety glasses, but these are practically goggles. All in all, I can't imagine you'd have a pair of eyeglasses or sunglasses that wouldn't fit.<br /><br />DURABILITY<br />I haven't had them for too long, so I can't say they stand the test of time, but these boxes seem pretty sturdy. Since they are handling something as delicate as eyeglasses, I can't imagine they'll take a beating, anyhow. These sit on top of my dresser, stacked on top of the other. They feel pretty durable to me<br /><br />APPEARANCE<br />A large part of why I purchased these boxes is to de-clutter the top of my dresser. I had 8+ pair of eyeglasses all over the place. These definitely helped to clear things up and they look nice too. My only complaint (and the reason for the 4 out of 5 stars) is that one of the boxes came with a big scratch on the top, pretty visible in the clear plastic. I keep this box on the bottom of the stack to hide the blemish.<br /><br />Overall, I'd recommend these boxes as a great way to declutter your space and organize your eyeglasses or sunglasses or both!",1678863328083,1,true

4,It's not a water-resistant fabric (but it's machine washable),"BASE: First of all, this comes with no base.

I don't really have an issue with that.<br /><br />COLOR: The colors are of the peach/pale pink variety as the product photos show, but they aren't as bright.<br /><br />MATERIAL: This material isn't the waterproof material that you usually see with tents. It's softer and made of cotton: almost as if someone took comfortable bedsheets and made a tent with them. I immediately put all the fabric parts in the washer and dryer before making up the tent because we used this on top of a mattress. It looked even better after washing on cool and drying on low heat, so I recommend that.<br /><br />SETUP & SIZING: This was (thankfully) so easy to setup that I didn't need any instructions. Even my 6-year-old figured out several of the steps herself. As far as the sizing goes... I'd say it's spot on because the Full size I got doesn't fit on the Queen mattress I got it for (with attaching it to the mattress). It does fit on top of the mattress though when I have it there without being attached to anything.<br /><br />OVERALL: My daughter absolutely loves this tent and I'm happy that she's happy (and also that I'm able to wash it).

The only downside to these is that they don't lock in place after you unfold them so I feel uneasy about getting up or moving too much because I don't want the chair to slip and fold up, causing me to fall.",1678737391238,0,false

4,Pretty thick plastic,"The plastic in the main attachment feels durable enough to last and has a good weight to it, but it is just plastic with the tiniest bit of metal. Thankfully it comes together already, but I know it'll be a headache to put this apart and put it back together. Granted, this is my first attachment for my KitchenAid mixer, but I don't see myself using this again soon and I don't like the high price point (around $100).",1677013898508,0,false
3,These are SMALL,"The description photos with food on the racks are completely misleading. These are about the size of a large hand with the fingers spread out.

However, my excitement soon wavered and disappointment set in. The knives look nice and cut well, but not THAT much better than the $80ish set I got from Costco a few years ago. I only ever wash these by hand, but the handle has faded and dried out or something and they feel as if I need to oil them after only a month or so. And the SCISSORS?!?! Walmart quality at BEST, oh my goodness. My cheaper Costco scissors - and basically every other pair of scissors in my home - are better than these! I still can't believe it.",1674267262288,0,false
4,IT BROKE! But…,"I'm so sad that this vacuum broke almost immediately. I do have tile floors and it is my fault that it fell 2-3x, but honestly, my other vacuums have been through this without breaking (and they're cheaper!).<br /><br />The design of this is comparable to my Dyson but it's definitely not as durable. It doesn't get underneath shorter kid tables well because it won't bend downwards far enough without the vacuum head lifting up and vacuuming the air instead of the floor.<br /><br />********EDITED: Although the vacuum did break at the dirt compartment latch because it fell a few times on hard tile, customer service has been some of the best I’ve ever received. They resolved the issue and have been extremely attentive to the matter, so I’ve added 2 stars, giving this a total of 4 stars from me.",1674265862513,0,false
4,Not incredibly outstanding but they work for kids,"Overall, I really like these glasses and would recommend them for kids or parties where you don't want something super fancy. These are better than I'd expect from the dollar store and good for this price point, but they aren't perfect. The designs are on the thinner side and aren't as nice as some similar glasses I've gotten.",1674261990149,0,false
4,SO lightweight and effective on tile & carpet,"I love this vacuum so much more than I thought I would! It's lightweight so I don't break a sweat when vacuuming the whole house and it cleans up bigger-sized things (slightly smaller than the size of a peanut m&m). The light at the end of the vacuum is super bright but I've gotten used to it. It bends well so I can reach under my kid table and get whatever is hiding under there.<br /><br />The only downsides are:<br />- It doesn't work as well on my thin Ruggable rug<br />- The power button placement is a bit inconvenient. It's inside the handle that you hold as you vacuum, so it's too easy to accidentally push it. Unless you have smaller hands or hold it differently, you'll need to keep a couple of fingers up as you vacuum which gets annoying & difficult after a while.",1674191003217,0,false
4,Not for the weak (or weary),"I'll start out by saying that these are really nice. The metal is of great quality, the measurements inside are such a nice feature, and food doesn't stick easily. However... attaching the handle isn't as easy as I expected. It took a good amount of strength to properly attach it to the pot I wanted to use, and even then I wasn't so sure that it would stay on. When handling boiling temperatures, it's not something I am so eager to try. Still, I had no issues cooking and picking up the pan with food inside of it.<br /><br />The handle does have a sort of safety mechanism built-in because you need to tighten the handle on there and then turn a second knob/lever/thing on the handle to make sure it's fully secure.<br /><br />I'd say this set is perfect for someone living in a smaller home, an RV, or something similar to those.",1674114270895,2,false

3,Forget their customer service email address,"I've used the pans a few times in the house, to test them out, and they worked fine.  I purchased them to replace a set I was previously using in the travel trailer.  The gripping handles seem sturdy enough.  Other than that, I can't address the durability issue.  However, the set of pans came with one extra bottom part of the knob for the lids.  And didn't come with the needed screw and washer for the second complete knob set. So, I email customer service, as suggested on their literature if you're missing parts or need replacements.  After 10 days I emailed again.  Finally got a reply, telling me their staff was all out with covid or other illnesses.  Then I was told the pans were out of stock with Amazon and they'd have to wait for more to get in to send me the missing parts. Um, no, that's not how Amazon Fulfillment works. They stock the entire set, not spare parts.  Nor are they going to pull apart a set to send you what's missing.  So, yeah, the blurbie on their literature is incorrect.  Husband went to the hardware store and got me what I needed.  If your literature says to contact you for missing parts, then you'd better well have them on hand to mail to your customers.  I knocked a star off the rating due to this lapse in customer service.",1674023053741,4,true
3,Be aware of hot glue dripping down!,"I've purchased several of these at the same time (1 for travel trailer, 1 for vending at craft shows and one as a gift) and I like it much better (for the most part) than my previous one from another company that I got several years ago.  I really like how easily this one closes - huge improvement over my other one, which I really struggled with.  I use a piece of parchment paper inside which helps with cleanup.  It heats up hotter and faster than my old one, so I'm still learning that aspect of it.  However what I'm not happy about is how hot glue (or so it appears) has dripped down on to the power cord inside where it attaches.  Over time it got harder and harder to remove it (a/c cord) and finally I had to have my husband remove it with a pair of vise grips and even then it was hard to remove.  We found hot glue on it.  I did put it back in and won't be removing it, which could be a problem when I want to use the 12v attachment for when I want to use it in the vehicle.  I like the carrying case.  But yeah, not too impressed with the hot glue.  I keep meaning to write to the seller about it.",1672638353239,2,true

3,"Sorry, I Hate This Fryer—The picture is NOT the unit under review.","This review is for the 2 quart fryer. For some reason, Amazon associated the wrong picture with this review. The fryer I’m reviewing is shown with this review.<br /><br />Had two Cuisinart fryers. This is my second, and I hate it. My first was the 1.1 quart model and it is by far a better product.<br /><br />This 2 quart model is clunky to use and does not reach sufficient temperature to brown and crisp things. The basket handle IS NOT attached to the basket and that makes for a dangerous (my opinion) situation where handle and basket can come apart, potentially spilling hot oil on counters, and maybe even you. The handle and basket combo is such that the basket must be placed into the oil at a very odd, difficult to manage angle. This makes removal and draining of excess oil a challenging mess. The basket is smaller than the 1.1 qt model, so all you’re doing is using more oil.<br /><br />This Cuisinart product is the most disappointing I’ve purchased under this brand. I do not recommend it.<br /><br />I DO RECOMMEND the 1.1 quart model, as its design is excellent. The difference in capacity is about the amount of oil, not the amount you can fry in one batch. If you are looking for a home deep fryer go with the 1.1qt model.<br /><br />DO USE PEANUT OIL AS IT CAN REACH THE NECESSARY HIGH TEMPERATURES WITHOUT SMOKING OR CATCHING FIRE.",1673536654369,0,false

As a result, they don't sit flat on any surface you place them on and rock from corner to corner. You can look down the sides and see that the two sets of corners do not line up with each other. I've had to exchange every pan I've received. The worst I've seen was over 1/8 of an inch rocking/wobble in one of the pans I exchanged. Even the replacements have slight wobbles, although it's improved. That's a shame though because outside of wobbles and twists, it's a very nice set of pans.<br /><br />Overall, these pans are heavy and seem tough enough to resist chipping.

I had it within a week.  If you are looking for a chair that is adjustable and comfortable, this chair is NOT that chair.",1676036746139,0,false

4,So Quite!,"I bought the Lasko Portable Electric 42"" Oscillating Tower Fan with Fresh Air Ionizer in the in the Blackwood T42950, for my 21yr old son's room.<br />The reason I chose to look for a tower fan was it doesn’t take up much floor space, it is taller and off the floor and circulates the cool air better.<br />The number one reason I bought this model was for its IONIZER! It neutralizes ODORS!!!<br />I did say I bought this for my 21yr old sons room right! Lol… seriously that is the only reason I bought it!<br />A Con for me-<br />I DO NOT care for the colors at all. It is 42” tower of a whole lot of BLACK  with a faux wood front which would be beautiful in the right home that has a decor that can compliment its heavy modern look. I prefer a lighter colors that disappear 🫥 or isn’t the first thing you notice when you walk in the room.<br /><br />AFTER Some mental internal debate with myself this is why I bought it-<br />It is for my sons room so it will go well with his particular interior design style of Post Apocalyptic. It will look great with his unfolded tossed about laundry and whatever else! Most importantly hopefully it will SMELL BETTER.<br />Oh I almost forgot It has a Timer and Remote Control which is a plus as well.<br /><br />PRO- it is so bloody quite even on high!! I had to check if it was on at the low setting ! Love that! Now he can’t say he couldn’t hear me because the fan is too loud!! Extra Pro he can’t use that as his defense… lol 😂<br /><br />I have a light silver tower Lasko tower fan that I bought for my garage. I love that one but it’s loud. I love the light silver color because it’s not over bearing in color.<br />I hope they come out with a light color one I would buy it for my bedroom to help with menopause hot flashes and the Ionizer will  help with my husbands night long expelling of the gas from his bowels… ugh 😩<br /><br />Seriously great fan super quite and builds well!<br />I gave 4 stars ⭐️ because of the color options if they has another one in a light color it would have given it 6 stars ⭐️!",1677262328259,4,true

3,Marginal success - 29K reviews clearly know what they are doing better than me I guess..,"There are multiple steps to what should be relatively simple.<br />1. Cleaning the surface. For a window, this can be a challenge if there is a wood trim securing the window. There is typically wood debris/paint on edges. I used a knife specifically for windows which is basically a flat razor blade.<br />2. Measuring and cutting to size. I have 3 small windows at the top of the front door I wanted covered. Cutting 3 pieces evenly was a bit of a challenge but I am about 99% accurate.<br />3.  Mounting. Here is where things went a bit off the rails. It clearly states to make the surface as wet as possible. However, the issue is, the pieces move around alot while trying to get bubbles out. I eventually gave up on all the bubbles and the pieces look reasonably good......from a distance.<br /><br />All up, I would probably use again. However, I would want:<br />1. Something to cut perfectly straight. (not just scissors)<br />2. Try different methods for mounting to reduce bubbles.<br /><br />Will see how they hold up over time...",1678819956472,0,true

1,"Honestly, this thing has been such a pain","So, we got this because there's a huge opening behind our mattress under our headboard where a bunch of our stuff would just fall through and end up ender the bed and headboard. However, we underestimated how huge it was. We tried sleeping with it for one night and it was so uncomfortable. It raised the pillows to an uncomfortable angle so our necks and backs were in pain the next day. My husband is tall and we have a king sized bed, so we can't just slide the pillows lower to avoid this. So, we tried to flip it upside down and pin it between the mattress and the headboard. Unfortunately, this just made it easier for the mattress to slip and slide around and the wedge would just sink, making our pillows also sink at the opposite angle. I tried nailing the cell phone pockets to the headboard but the middle still sinks and the edges don't stay as high as we need them to. I've been having to make up the difference by folding up a towel and putting that between my pillow and the wedge. We have to mess with this thing every day to fix our pillow heights and it's super frustrating.<br /><br />On the plus side, it does keep things from falling under the bed. That is the reason why we haven't returned it yet. I just got something to help keep the mattress from sliding, so hopefully that will just fix the issue altogether.",1673150711412,3,true

1,Nearly useless,"After receiving these, but prior to using them, I left a raving review, but now they are nearly useless. I followed the instructions for washing them, which I did, of course, before planning to use them. I placed the lids in the top rack of my dish washer, and when the cycle finished I TRIED to secure the lids onto the bowls. I was able to snap shut only one or two of the four sides in place. The only bowl that I was able to fully secure the lid onto was the smallest. Granted, I have arthritis in my hands, but never have I had this issue with a set like this from another manufacturer. So, here I am with bowls without the advantage of a proper lid. Again, this is the only set of bowls with snapping lids that has not worked out for me. I absolutely do NOT recommend this product.

4,Really nice storage jar though a bit tall,"I saw these and figured they would be perfect for holding cereal and bulk items like rice and pasta. On a whole they are very nice jars and the lids fit in tight and secure. The drawback is because of the height of the handle on the top, they are about a half inch to tall to fit on a standard pantry shelf, unless you are storing them on the top shelf, which becomes a little awkward handling them at that point. The only other option is to leave them out on the counter, which defeats the purpose of having a pantry. I have them on the top shelf right now, so they didn't go to waste.",1675735033048,0,false

The saying is only on 1 side too, and no other design, which is a little disappointing. I was also surprised that it came in 1 piece, since it was just plopped into the box with no packing to protect it.

One thing to note, is that a sneaker is about the largest thing you can fit on the rack spaces. If you have boots, they need to go on top. As far as sturdiness, if you are using it for shoes, you should be alright. I can't see putting anything heavy on it. Also, you can add units to it to make it taller. I would be very hesitant to do that though unless you are going to try to anchor it to a wall. It is doing the job I got it for, so that is a plus",1672765298605,0,false

Even with a couple hours of indirect sunlight, the glow never appeared. I haven't tested it with a ton of direct sunlight  because I don't have time and space for that, and this isn't a blanket i want to use outside, so there's no point in hanging it outside just to get sunlight.

They all seem so overly big nowadays. There’s a lot of extra material and since it doesn’t zip up and just folds over folds over, the pillow doesn’t seem to want to stay in and the end just kind of flops around.  if you only want to use it for looks and that’s it, it will do.

We contacted the seller, who offered to send replacement parts so we could fix it. After giving them the list of what we would need, they offered instead to send a full replacement.

3,I miss the older GF grills,"While I love the space this grill provides, I miss being able to take the plates off and wash them separately. These plates don’t come off, so I have to carefully wash them while trying not to get soapy water in the machine. There is no temperature control, which I knew when I bought it, but the feature rating section asked me about anyway so I thought I’d put it in my review. It is easy to use otherwise, but the few times I’ve used it, it’s started smoking as it reached its max temperature. That makes me nervous.

2,Damages your floors,"One the face of it, this is a great vacuum. LiDAR navigation, virtual walls, relatively quiet. That is why it gets an extra star, especially being around $200. However, no matter how great this vacuum is, it is all moot when it damages your floors. This appears to be a common issue if you research this vacuum online. Where ever this vacuum stops for an extended period of time, such as next to charger, it will burn in tread marks from the wheels. No amount of rubbing alcohol, wd-40, etc will get rid of those. You will get those marks if you are an owner of this thing. Not great if you are renting or care about your floor. I complained before to Wyze, they sent me one that was “fixed”. That one was worse than the one it replaced.<br /><br />As you can see in the photos, I tried a silicon mat to protect my already damaged floors. in the span of two weeks it developed large brown marks. Better it than the floor, but still not great.<br /><br />As soon as I can save up for one of the more reputable brands, this thing is gone.<br /><br />Wyze sells appealing items but you get what you pay for. Robot vacuum plastic tires that destroy floors, scales that have swollen batteries that make it impossible to replace, etc. The company cheaps out on components to get the low price and we wind up paying for it in the end.",1678125919909,0,false

The way the temps are displayed makes them fuzzy and unclear when you are trying to choose the water temperature. Once the kettle has reached the temperature you have chosen, you will hear 3 beeps but not see what temperature you have selected. I know this is probably a little thing to dislike about this kettle but aesthetics are important. I would like it so much better if a signal light was displayed next to the selected temperature or the temps were displayed in a different color than the same color as the white kettle.",1677347886984,1,true
4,"Beautiful jars, but I can't get my question answered","The description for these jars states you can put jams and jellies in them, but I need to know if they are considered suitable for actual canning, water bath and/or pressure canning, if used with proper canning lids and rings (which do fit these jars). The threads on the jars match other canning jars I have, but I need to verify that this particular colored glass will hold up if used for canning. I have asked this question on the sales page twice, and I have received no answer. I'm knocking off a star for not being able to get this important information, which should be included in the description and specs, yay or nay, because I really would love to use these jars to gift canned foods.<br /><br />The jars themselves are gorgeous, and they come nicely packaged in closed-cell foam with ample amounts of jute twine and classy (if small) brown cardboard labels to make gifting easy. For items that are not canned, such as dehydrated foods and spices, the one-piece lids have a good airtight seal. I would keep these lids for myself to use with my regular mouth canning jars for storing dry foods and gift the jars with a regular ring and lid IF I can use them for canning. All thirty jars fit on the top rack of my dishwasher for sanitizing, which is nice. They hold 8 ounces as advertised (or a little bit under if minding headspace, just as the 8 oz. Ball jars do), yet they take up about the same space as a 4 oz. Ball jelly jar, they're just a little taller. Very efficient use of space.<br /><br />Tip for the Kratky-crazed mason jar folks among us: The two pieces of closed-cell foam are perfect to repurpose as floating Kratky-style pond rafts (see photos). They provide a suitable air layer for air roots. I love it when I can get extra mileage out of a product's packaging so I can keep trash out of the landfill!<br /><br />If my question about the suitability of these jars for actual canning does get answered finally, I will happily give these jars five stars.",1678982038495,0,false
4,Very tight fit for Instant Pot Mini,"The photos show one of these air fryer liners sitting on top of the stainless steel trivet that came with my 3-quart Instant Pot Mini. It's a tight fit; when I first put it in, it folded in a little, but I was able to push it flat out to the sides. This makes the liner almost seal against the sides of the pot. Rather than use them in an air fryer, I wanted these to cook cakes or cornbread in my Mini, and it may well be that it's a good thing that it's tight (to keep most of the steam out of the top when under pressure). Normally one has to cover the batter with foil to keep the steam out. But I think these are nice liners that will make good jello molds, even if I wind up not using them for what I got them for. The tabs on the side will be useful but are unobtrusive enough not to be in the way.",1678814048321,0,false
4,Beautiful and substantial except for the box,"First, what I love: This little keepsake urn is very heavy, which reflects the ""heavy"" meaning of a person's passage and the weight and sum of their life. My dear sister sickened suddenly and died some years ago, and she was completely shocked. We'd been talking about her selling her condo in the city and moving in with me in a smaller town, where I was building a forest garden and incorporating all kinds of critters, frogs, chickens, etc. She said to me: ""I never expected this to happen! We were going to live the rest of our lives watching Chicken TV together!"" When she was in hospice, I told her that I would scatter her ashes in the chicken run and buy a Rhode Island Red chicken for her spirit to come live in so we could still do our Chicken TV. This seemed to give her peace.<br /><br />Long story short: The chickens I ordered by mail all died in transit, which just seemed to be an omen or message of some kind, so instead of scattering them, I put my sister's ashes in an aluminum tin in a drawer in my room, and I've always felt very unsettled about it. So when I saw this urn, in the deep purple color that was my sister's favorite, I knew I was meant to get it. It's the perfect size for me to keep sitting out on my desk, always visible, so I'll think about her every day and can feel like she's with me. The urn isn't large enough to hold ALL of her ashes, but the rest of them I will scatter in the chicken run when I get ""her"" chicken as I'd promised her. It may sound crazy, but it feels like a sign that now's the time to fulfill my promise to her.<br /><br />But to the objective review for others considering buying this keepsake urn: The box this beautiful urn comes in, which could have been lovely, was marred by scuffs and a torn edge and what looks like a person's fingerprints covered in glue, no doubt from assembling the box. The dark blue satin cloth ""bed"" inside is lovely, especially next to the rich purple and brass urn, but I'd never give this as a gift to others if I was in a position to be handing out keepsake urns at the time of someone's death and cremation. I do very much like that the threading of the lid is deep to ensure the urn stays closed, and I was able to fill it easily by makeshifting a funnel with a wide mouth out of a piece of card stock. For me, it's a five-star product because I don't need the box, but I'm knocking off a star for the used-looking box.",1678812503753,0,false
3,It's not a Lomi,"I felt a little guilty ordering this product for review because I already have a Lomi composter that I use daily. I thought I'd compare the two, and I will say that this QMCAHCE does yield a product that is more dry and powdery than the Lomi does. For some, this alone will make it worth having. And I do recommend a composter of this type to anyone who produces a lot of kitchen scraps and wants to be able to help cut down on the amount of food waste that winds up in our landfills. If you are an aging gardener, like me, who no longer has the strength to manage a traditional compost pile, you will also benefit from having one.<br /><br />I'm going to tell you what I do not like about this composter; all of this combined is why I only give it three stars. It is NOT because it does not work or is cheaply made. It does work, and except for the removable door on the back, which was a little fiddly, it seems at least as well made as the Lomi. But at 14"" tall with a hinged lid for bucket removal, it cannot ""live"" under my kitchen cabinet beside the sink, as my Lomi does. Maybe my cabinets are mounted lower than yours are, but if not, you'll have to find a place to put it where you can access it easily but also be able to remove the bucket without moving the unit. If you have, say, the wiring in place and enough clearance to stick it up under the sink, it would work better than the Lomi for that purpose because it is a tidy rectangular shape around which other items can sit.<br /><br />I'm not sure how I feel about the filter cartridge. On the one hand, unlike with the Lomi, it has the charcoal contained inside the filter so you don't have to deal with charcoal dust when changing out the charcoal. A replacement cartridge costs $10 at the time of this writing, and you're supposed to replace it every 3 to 6 months. The Lomi's filter is refillable, so that cuts down on the use of plastic, and there are cheaper sources for the charcoal pellets than getting them from Lomi. I have not tried to open up the filter on this composter to see if it can be reused, but if it can be then it's okay because the same charcoal pellets used by the Lomi could be used in this. If it's a throwaway plastic item, however, that's a negative. The spent charcoal is good to add to your soil, by the way, so don't throw it away!<br /><br />What I really dislike the most about this composter is that you can't shut it up. When I first turned on the composter, I was greeted by a Geiko Gecko-sounding male voice giving me some nice positive feedback: ""Hello. Thank you for your contribution to protecting the environment."" How cool, I thought. As the composter cycled through Dry, Grind, Cool, UV, the voice reliably told me what the composter was starting to do. When you start it up again: ""Hello. Thank you for your contribution to protecting the environment."" Let me tell you, after you hear this a few times, you never want to hear it again, and yet there does not appear to be a way to turn it off. If I even barely touch the lid: ""Hello. Thank you for your contribution to protecting the environment."" Open the lid and close it again: ""Hello. Thank you for your contribution to protecting the environment."" Okay, yeah, I know, I know already! This really gets on my nerves.<br /><br />On the positive side, I don't think the Lomi has a UV cycle like this one does; it sanitizes the dried waste and supposedly destroys any pathogens. It would destroy any good bacteria that you might want to have in your garden, too, but for germophobes it's probably a good thing. This composter has one processing cycle and a Clean cycle; the Lomi has no Clean but three different cycles, and the only one I ever use is the default one.<br /><br />This composter costs a lot less than a Lomi, and it does seem to do as good of a job with the food waste as the Lomi does (if anything, it dries and pulverizes it better) but, for me, based on the negatives mentioned above, I would not buy it. Your wants and needs may be different from mine, so you might be happy with it. If you have young kids, they'd probably love that Gecko voice...",1678039961768,2,false
4,Just right for keeping finished kefir or kombucha in the fridge,"These swing-top glass bottles are attractive and are great to store effervescent water kefir or kombucha in the fridge. You could also use them for that leftover wine or special vinegars. I don't have a Sodastream type product, but they'd probably be good for homemade carbonated beverages as well. They'd be too pricey to bottle a large batch of beer or wine, of course, and you'd really like darker glass for that purpose.",1678037528107,0,false

3,Be careful not to drop the screws!,"The screws that you use to affix the tall holder rod to the base are very tiny. Fortunately, mine came with an extra screw because I couldn't find the one I dropped! Just be very careful when you put this thing together. It includes a tiny little allen wrench to screw the screws in, and it looks nice once assembled, but I would have preferred this to be all in one piece. It remains to be seen if those screws will hold up because they are not the most solid. I'm not sure much was gained by having it in two pieces from a packaging standpoint.",1677803927751,0,false
4,It's going to work for what I wanted it for,"I wanted a strong pole for hanging planters so I can spray dust off the leaves and tend to them without making a big mess at the kitchen sink. I never take showers, only baths, so the space above the tub enclosure is really wasted anyway. I've got one of those elliptical shower curtain rods on the outside of the tub, and this fit just perfectly in the center of the tub enclosure and tucked up nicely against the never-used shower head.<br /><br />This rod was designed for shower curtains and window curtains. They say you can use it as a wardrobe hanger or in a closet, but I think it would bow too much if much weight is hung on it. Fortunately, it looks like I should be able to stick a long piece of rebar inside the rode to help fortify it so it can handle the weight of heavy planters; you may want to do the same for heavy coats. I like the rubberized ends that prevent marring the wall.",1676648394310,0,false
4,Thin. Will get the job done.,"Mine arrived all spilled out of the cardboard box they came in, and the box completely apart at the seams (with no sign of shipping damage on package), so it's going to be a real trick to get these all turned straight and stored in another box. I'm knocking off a star for the flimsy box. Knowing these wax paper squares will be used often and need to be pulled from the box flat, I would recommend they come up with a better packaging solution. It's great that they're not packed in plastic, but maybe they could glue the cardboard together better?<br /><br />Anyway, these are a good size for what they are for, which is hamburger patty dividers. The cheaper bags of pre-pressed hamburger patties often do not have lining sheets between them and they wind up sticking together and have to be defrosted to cook them singly. This is not a problem when entertaining a crowd, but we're just two people, so I will use these liners to repack any burger patties we buy that don't have them. They are a good size to use as covers with my 5x5 microgreen/seedling trays, and they'll also work well to store freshly made balls of farmer cheese. They are not, of course, for baking in the oven; you need parchment paper for that.",1676063732996,1,false
4,The narrow profile fits well into my crowded bedroom,"First, I'm knocking off a star because there was a hairline crack across the underside of the top piece that I'm hoping will not undermine the integrity of the piece. But other than that, everything was very well machined and relatively easy to put together. They could have had a bunch of slightly different pieces that would have been madness to assemble, but they made it easy. I especially appreciated that the inner pieces were all the same. The little combo hex wrench/Philips head screwdriver is a keeper!<br /><br />Keep the styrofoam piece to set the top on when assembling so you don't scratch it, and be sure the little curved lips are all on the same side and pointed DOWNWARD (because, when you flip the dresser over, they will be pointed up and serve to stop the drawers from pushing too far back). There is a certain zen feeling to putting together a piece like this: After checking to ensure all parts were included, it's just a matter of patiently screwing the pieces together, and the first level is the hardest. One dyslexic person can do it. Do NOT tighten the screws down until after you get the next layers added on or you will be sorry.<br /><br />I liked how the layers of parts went together and covered the screws from the last layer. I love that the frame is metal because magnetic hooks and pushpins will stick to it. Now I won't always be losing my Aftershokz, and I can also use magnetic hooks to help route cables. I've got my iPad set up on top so it's by my bed along with a place for a glass. It all fits neatly underneath the shelves I put on my wall to hold things that I was always piling up on my desk. While hardware is included to anchor this to the wall, I didn't do it. I won't be sitting anything heavy on it, so I opted to adjust the little feet thingies to angle up slightly higher in the front. There's room for shoes underneath.<br /><br />Finally, I'm really into ""banker's colors"" (black, blue, brown, grey), but that means my decor can seem a bit dark and drab at times. The colors of this dresser fit in with my style but also add a nice punch of color and creativity to the space. Now I just need to do something about my bed.",1675794217068,1,false
4,"Cheap, pretty disposable, exactly what I wanted","I'm planning to brood baby chicks in a little-used bathtub this spring, and I wanted some kind of shower curtain liner to hang into the tub and tape to the walls to keep the chicks from jumping out. I was concerned about toxicity of the various types of plastic liners, but after having read up on the materials this is made of, I think it's probably the safest of the available options in my price range. This liner has no smell and seems perfect for what I want to use it for. It's not the most attractive thing in the world; I would have preferred just white for a liner, but this is what I was offered to review. I'm glad to have it.",1675792224958,0,false
4,They work best with non-adjustable shelves,"I have some pine shelves that are adjustable that I wanted to use for canned goods, but I was afraid the little shelf pins would not be strong enough to hold a ton of filled canning jars. I didn't want to permanently alter the shelves by nailing in wooden supports, so I thought I would try these to add a little extra support. They work fine for that purpose, although they are tricky to get positioned correctly because the shelves lift up. I had to work shelf by shelf, putting weight on each one in increments for the tension rods to stay put and not fall over. But now that they are in place, I think they will get the job done. They seem to work best placed in the center of the shelf and not in the corners.",1675187068011,1,true

This doesn't have a hanging hole, but the angled handle hooks over my utensil rod and hangs just fine without falling.",1674083718191,0,true
4,Normally I really love these Whitmor shelf units,"I use them all over the house, often reconfiguring them into different looks and functions as our needs change.

I got this so I can grow microgreens over my bathroom sink, and it's just the right size and adjustability for that. It was going to be too much of a hassle to exchange it, so I'll just have to live with the warped shelf.",1674070394720,0,true
3,"This shows promise for helping track nutrition and portions, but app needs work","Let me say up front that I'm knocking off a few stars because the Momax APP that pairs with this otherwise superb, streamlined, easy-to-use, beautiful scale is not quite ready for prime time (at least not for this device; it works with IoT). Despite my being about 50 lbs. overweight, it determined that I'm underweight and calculated my recommended caloric intake accordingly. I could not find a way to manually change these calculations. I suspect this is because that portion of the program has not yet been programmed or debugged; that, or I haven't been using it long enough for it to have a sense of where I am...although I did enter my age, height, and weight in the personal settings and you'd think it would know to start with those numbers.<br /><br />Another thing less than ideal with the app is that it has a preponderance of weird food items that might be eaten in Asian countries but are generally not known or available in the U.S. The first ""plate"" I logged (as Breakfast, nice!) included Brie (listed as ""Cheese, brie,"" as it should have been) and an apple. But there was no listing for ""Apple."" When I searched for ""apple,"" I got Crabapples and Rose-apples, Mammy-apple, and Pineapple. I figured it didn't have regular old apples, so I picked Rose-apple, wondering if they didn't mean a red apple. Or did they mean rosehips?<br /><br />It's very difficult to find items by scrolling through the extremely unhelpful unalphabetized list because it has many duplicates (e.g., raw figs at least three times in a row, many other fruits duplicated but with the exact same name in the list). It was only by happenstance, when I was looking for something else, that I happened upon ""Apples, raw, without skin""; scrolling all the way through from the top to the bottom of the Fruit and Fruit Juices list, the only other entry was ""Apples, raw, golden delicious, with skin"" but nothing for firm/tart apples with skin. Then I searched for ""Apple"" and got completely different results from the ""apple"" search, so it's clear they have some kind of case-sensitivity built in that should NOT be there. It does appear they have a way to indicate favorite foods (a heart icon) and also a way to custom-add foods; this makes me wonder if custom-added foods are being put into the main food bank as duplicates. This, too, should not be possible or they'll have a big unwieldy mess.<br /><br />But somebody does have the right idea. When I selected ""Cheese, brie"" and placed my slice of brie on the scale, it weighed the brie and transferred the data to the app. Assuming the data and the calculations done by the app are accurate, you wind up with an exact calculation of how many calories you are consuming as well as the exact nutritional information for that portion of food. You can save ""plates"" (which are combinations of items eaten at the same meal, each weighed and calculated separately) and then, at the end of the day, see a combined total of what you have consumed. It also appears that this app will track your weight loss goals (you can set desired pounds a week to lose, for example) and provide feedback on how you're doing.<br /><br />If they can ever get the app up to snuff, this scale and the Momax app will have My Fitness Pal beat. They do need a way to allow people to enter custom recipes; perhaps adding a custom ""plate"" is the way to go, but I haven't tried that yet. You can choose to interface the Momax app with Alexa, Google Assistant, DuerOS, Tencent Xiawei, DingDong, Rokid, and Tmall Genie (only two of which I recognize).<br /><br />Finally, I have had a great deal of difficulty pairing a lot of wireless devices to our internet service (Spectrum) because the 2.4 and 5g bands are combined and things often won't pair. But this scale apparently pairs with the app on your smart phone, not the router, which is a good thing. You can use the scale without using the app, but it won't have all the bells and whistles. But it's a pretty scale, easy to clean, and very easy to work with if you only want a scale. When I set mine up, I authorized the app to provide data but unchecked the box for allowing them to send me advertisements and tips.",1673807088354,0,false

I am trying to eliminate all plastics from my life, but I couldn't resist these jars because they are so pretty. They come packaged with the smaller jars inside the larger ones, so they don't take up a huge amount of space if you need to store them. I plan to load these up with home-dehydrated foods, and the labels that come with the set will be most helpful in keeping track of them.",1673221517419,0,false

1,Ended up returning these,"I get nightly migraines and have trouble finding a pillow that works well for me. I can't tolerate memory foam and anything too hard causes head and ear pain. I also need something cooling and all those type pillows always seem to be memory foam and absurdly expensive. This pillow was advertised as cooling and comfortable so I figured I'd give it a shot since it wasn't that expensive.<br /><br />When the box arrived, I was shocked at how heavy it was. The pillows are vacuum packed and tightly rolled. You have to carefully cut the sealed plastic and let them plump up for about an hour. They are surprisingly heavy pillows. They don't shift around at night at all unless you purposely move them. Do not expect these to be firm pillows. They are what I call 'poofy'. You lay your head on them and immediately sink into it. Initially I thought these pillows would be okay. The first few nights were fine and I slept well.<br /><br />Unfortunately after giving them ten days, they got worse. They lost all poof entirely and my head sank completely to the bed. My ear actually hurt during the night and I had to toss around and try to plump the pillow up several times during the night. In addition, they are very hot pillows. They have no cooling at all and are actually hotter to sleep on then the original ordinary pillows I was replacing.

2,Quality and Customer care from  FJS DEALZ INC was very poor,"While the crock pot operates as expected however when it arrived we notice immediately that the inner cooking pot had a chip exposing the white underlying material. After further inspection we noticed numerous little blister looking bubbles in the finish. Upon contacting  and supplying FJS DEALZ INC with a photo of the chip, we simply  requested that they replace the defective cooking pot. They offered a $20.00 discount which is a fraction of the cost to replace the defective item. We could have sent it back but that was  not a good solution since we would have to drive 40 minutes to the nearest UPS return office. I would NOT recommend this supplier to anyone.

The holes did NOT align between some of the upright panels, and therefore I had to drill my own holes in one panel to make sure the shelves fit properly. Before I drilled the holes, I also unassembled the table to make sure I did not have the panels facing in the wrong direction.

4,Big & powerful blender,"[[VIDEOID:ba6fb35b27da8ccba894ad1c446d7794]] Pros & cons. First, it is really big. For me it is a con, it doesn’t even fit under my upper cabinets. It is also too tall to fit on the shelves in my pantry, so storage will be tricky. That being said it is a really powerful blender. It says ‘it turns ice into snow’, but my son made a fruit smoothie with frozen fruit & it didn’t go as smoothly as I hoped. It took a bit & we stopped the machine once or twice as it was giving off a smell. Not sure if that is just because it is new? He did ultimately get there though. That being said, most machines you can’t use frozen things, so it really is quite powerful. It has a high or variable option. The variable blends in pulses. I really like that it is made out of sturdy plastic. The glass carafe broke on our last blender. I am the only female in an all male household & they tend to be rough on glass. I am hoping for more longevity out of this one. I also like that there is only one way to put it on & it is easy to tell if it is flush, as another blender went cause my husband wouldn’t have carafe on properly & eventually grinded down the mechanism, to move the blade, on the carafe. It will be great for soups. My sons like their smoothies. As it is big, it appears to have a greater capacity, than other blenders I have owned. I guess if you have the space it is a good blender, that will get the job done. If you are working with a smaller space, unless you have the need for a big blender, this might not be right size wise. Powerful, but might not be for everyone.",1677415574736,0,false
4,Comfy & portable.,"The pillow came vacuum packed, so I allowed some time to allow it to fill in, before taking a picture or trying it out after opening. I like that it has a sectioned out part, that can fit under your neck. It is comfortable, but while I understand it is only a camp pillow, I do wish it was a little bit fuller. It fits easily in the travel pouch for portability. Seems like good quality. It is a nice pillow. A little pricey ($26.91 at time of review), but each person has to determine their own reasonable price point. No real cons, just what your preference is.",1677282489537,0,false

Worth a try!<br /><br />****Updated****<br />While this towel continues to be absorbent, it is already has some lose threads in the middle of the towel.

I do wish they were not as wrinkly out of the package. Due to the material they are made of, not sure how you could minimize that? It just doesn’t look very nice, but hoping laying out food, plates, utensils, etc. will make it less noticeable. I have tried disposable tablecloths, but they are thin, rip easily & if it is windy they are all over the place. These have weight, so can’t imagine wind will be as much of an issue. Easier cleanup if rain becomes an issue too. Have dealt with both & think this will be so much easier to use! As they are thick, they should hold up to almost everything, thinking extreme heat or flames being the exception. I might put a smaller cloth over the center to improve overall appearance. These being underneath, will still make cleanup a snap. Happy with this order & think it is a good long term investment for outdoor use.",1676222205846,1,false
4,Attractive medium sized ice bucket.,"The ice bucket is a little smaller than I thought it would be, but listing did state medium sized. It is an attractive design & made of stainless steel, which is my preference of material. I like that it has a strainer to allow water to drain away from ice. The bucket seems like good quality. The tongs a little less so, but they get the job done. I think it would be nicer if they were similar quality stainless steel vs. rubber covered tongs. It would continue the quality feel to the whole set. It came packaged well, with warranty information if there is an issue. Mine came without any problems. It makes entertaining easier to have a bucket for ice vs using a bowl. Keeps ice from melting too quickly & has a more mature look. I would recommend this ice bucket & happy with this addition to our bar.",1674695671581,0,false

The cover isn’t overly thick, but thicker than others I have looked at. It is a nice weave & neutral khaki color. I like the fringe, as it gives it a little extra interest. Goes nicely with the pillows I already had in place. Nice sofa cover, which worked well for our space. No negatives that I notice. Happy with this order.",1674334498893,0,false

If you are looking for fancy (to me) it just looks “nice”, but is boring.  I have lots of seasonal gnome decor, cause it is fun! To me at least. These Valentines gnomes are cute & colorful. One thing I like about these is there is a wire in the hat, so you can move it around or have it go in a certain direction. It was a bit tipsy, but I was able to manipulate whatever is at the bottom to make it more stable. The hearts lights are just a bonus. Not sure if I will use them, but it is a little something extra.

1,"Poor Customer Sevice, Bulky and Burning Odor","I used this immersion blender 4 times to make lotion emulsions. I didn't have it on continuously, nor use it on high. I used short quick pulses, and then maybe ran it for 20 seconds total. The lotions were not particularly viscous, but the unit had a burning smell, and, got rather hot. Furthermore, it's not very ergonomic. I wasn't able to hold it with one hand, as it's rather bulky, and slippery (no grip). I didn't use any of the attachments, so I can't offer input on them. The cord is also rather annoying, it tends to kink up in use and catch on things, not ideal. I can tell you that I contacted their customer support about the overheating and smell, and they took a week to get back to me, asked a lot of questions, and then finally decided that my intended use of making lotions wasn't appropriate lol. I am returning it to Amazon and will buy another brand. This was voted to be a good stick blender for soaping and making cosmetics on various blogs, but I wouldn't recommend it. Additionally, because the blade head shape is flat, it tends to create a suction of your product, and also creating air bubbles, so a lot of lotion gets sucked into the head. It's also not very easy to clean, as the head shape is very flat. Poor quality and poor customer service.",1677240744416,2,true

2,Excessively Thick Glass,"I purchased these to use for a product that occasionally needs to be shaken. These are worthless for that purpose. The glass is excessively thick which causes the bottle to be unnecessarily heavy to the point that it is difficult to maintain during shaking. The tops are snap-on and made from silicone. Very soft and easy to install but they fly off during the shaking. The pour spout has a vent hole that sprays liquid during the shaking process. When I analyze these bottles I see a container that, if dropped, could not possibly break due to the thickness of the glass, BUT, due to the weakness of the grip of the cap on the bottle, a fall would not cause breakage but would cause the bottle to empty due to the cap coming off. They may be great for someone's purpose but are worthless for mine. The weight of each bottle should be noted in the description. I would guess if the bottle was filled to the top with very cold liquid and set on a counter, before the contents reached room temperature the cap would have popped off due to expansion of the liquid as temperature rose.",1675880365397,0,true

I even tried using a blow-dryer thinking that I could shrink it to fit properly but it would not conform.  I will more than likely take the sleeve off completely and then all I have is a glass pitcher.  It is still a nice heavy pitcher…just not what I was looking for.  When the cover is on, it does not pour well at all.  Even when set with the opening of the cap toward the spout of the pitcher.  It dribbles out.

4,very wrinkled,"I got this cloth cover so that when I wanted to work on my antique dining room table I would be sure to protect it from scratches, glue and other craft supplies.  When I first opened it, it was overwhelmingly full of wrinkles!  So much so that I knew I couldn’t use it.  There was a note in the package that said it would be wrinkled.  Not to worry about it.  So they knew this was a problem.  They suggested two ways to get rid of SOME of the wrinkles.  The first way was to use a cool iron and a damp cloth to iron them away.  Don’t do it!  The iron didn’t do much for the wrinkles but wherever it touched left a high sheen.  Looks very spotty.  The other way was to use a blow dryer.  This did work to some extent…but did not take all the wrinkles out.  It does seem to be lessening with time but still doesn’t look good.  I suspect that when I take it off the table and store it, it will become wrinkled again as it is round and won’t easily fold.  Since this is only to be used as a protective cover it is fine and the elastic around it keeps in it place.  There is no strong odor to it at all.

I attempted to calibrate the thermometer with the ice water method, but after calibrating down to 32 degrees, it kept reading the ice water as below 32 degrees (before attempting this, I couldn’t get it to read lower than 33.5 in ice packed water – after calibrating to 32 degrees, it kept reading below 32, so the calibration just changed the inaccuracy from slightly above to slightly below).

Only noticeable on the two darkest dishes, and it still looks fine – just needs to be noted for those who are bothered by what some might consider an imperfection in the coloring process.<br /><br />The thin brown rim is odd – a dark blue rim would have been better, but it’s thin, so not a big deal.",1675474048744,1,false
4,Softness: 5 stars.  Thickness: 4 stars.  Design: 3 stars,"There are positives and negatives to this blanket. The biggest positive is that it is very soft, though it is thin. It would feel like fake fur if it were only thicker. The descriptions of “lightweight” and “all-seasons” (which I now know is code word for thin) are appropriate for this blanket. The listing says it will keep you cool in the summer and that may be true – as for warm in the winter, it’s too thin for me. Any breeze goes right through it.<br /><br />The biggest negative is the design. It is one-sided, so if you’re going to display it, you have to set it out very carefully so only the front shows. The cow patches don’t look too realistic, and because the color does not go through, you can see the white behind the black. Overall, this may be better for kids, and definitely for kids who want a blanket in the warmer seasons.<br /><br />As a final positive – it was slightly larger than the stated dimensions. Mine was 51x62 inches.",1675378935536,0,false
4,One had tear out from the cutting process. The “inlay” appears to be a sticker.,"These are just okay. They may be good for a kid’s room or a dark man cave. In the light, they show off their issues. One of mine had very noticeable tear-out on the side from the cross-cut. The animals appear to be decals applied to the wood and are not inlays. I was hoping they might have been laser cut into the wood, but they appear to be thin stickers on top of the wooden base.<br /><br />From a distance or without close examination, they do look nice. They are very light (just a few ounces each) and do not need the unnecessarily oversized hardware they came with. I found the thinnest nails I could and hung them on those. The pads are a nice, but unneeded touch, as they are thicker than the sawtooth hangers at the top; I hung mine without the pads. I debated for a long time on whether to give these three or four stars.",1675220270730,0,false
3,Deceptive listing – most pictures are not of the item you’ll get. Poorly sized.,"I didn’t realize it at the time I ordered, but the listing has several pictures of an item that is different than the one you will receive. Only three of the nine pictures are of the correct item. The pictures with the sloped edges to easily scoop up butter are not the item you will get. One of the correct pictures states there are scoop ramps, but they are not ramps – they are walls – much less accommodating to scooping than curved ramps; the pictures with curved ramps are for a different item than I received. The pictured dimensions are also incorrect, as this item is 11.5 cm wide, not 10 cm. Also, with the plastic cutting tab in place, you can not fit a full stick of butter – it is just a bit too big, so that you will either smear everything with butter as you try to cram it in or you will have to place the plastic tab to the side somewhere rather than in the slots where it goes. The fork holder doesn’t hold the fork well, as it’s not sized correctly. You have to place the fork just so or you won’t be able to put the lid on correctly. The lid just sets on; it does not lock into place.<br /><br />The plastic does seem solid. The lid is nice and thick and allows you to see what is inside – just don’t pick it up by the lid as it doesn’t lock into place. It has a 1950s plastic charm to it. I would rather have had the item in six of the nine pictures, but that is not what I received.",1675039678840,1,false
4,"Solid, beautiful, heavy, easy open with magnetic clasp.  Offset clip is smart.  ONE per package.","There is no English in the instructions, as noted in the pictures.  Despite the plural of the listing, you only get one clip, though you do get two scent balls, which you can saturate with your own fragrance/essential oil. They come slightly scented, but it is faint. The object is for you to apply whatever scent you want and the ball will absorb it. They are heavy, and may cause your vents to face downward, but because the clip that goes into the vent is offset, I found you can change which way you attach it to find the sweet spot, especially if there is a base below your vent for the deodorizer to rest on. The clip would also hold these on metal hangers for a closet (or you can just set it on a shelf), but the clip is designed for nothing thicker than a typical vent slat. If my car had old or cheap plastic slats, I would worry about the weight of this breaking the plastic. However, because they are so solid, they look good, and look more expensive than they are (based on the current price of 13 dollars).",1673718150130,0,false
4,Fairly accurate. I’d say  +/-  0.1 or 0.2  grams on average.,"I did a few tests with the scale with it sitting on the edge of a cutting board so that no motion from my holding it would interfere with results. I weighed out several pills and it was nearly consistent in giving the total weight, but the same pill combination would vary by 0.1 gram on the various trials.<br /><br />To test something heavier, I measured 3 quarters (quarters are 5.67 grams per) and the total was 16.9 to 17.1 grams, depending on which trial it was. Overall, this is more accurate than a standard kitchen scale, which only measures to the nearest whole gram, but if you need perfection, you may be slightly off. Weighing the same item three times and taking the average would probably get you very close. Certainly close enough for spices or similar uses in the kitchen.",1673144294582,0,false

Also, not sure if I'm supposed to remove the rubber stopper before I put the vacuum over it (no instructions) - when I did and went to put it on to seal, it took too long and it resisted plugging in, so the bag let in some air. Then I tried the vacuum again with that rubber seal in place and it worked better, then I just had to twist the cap on.

4,Great for Homebrewers.,"As a long-time home-brewer, I like to goto the local brew store to get fresh/crushed grain.  They often provide regular/plastic bags, which is ok, I like that I can use these for longer term storage in case my brew-date gets delayed. Diving right into the Pros/Cons:<br /><br />Pros:<br />- These bags are HUGE. You can pretty much get your whole grain-bill into one of these bags.<br />- Seems durable for multiple usage.<br />- Comes with O2 absorbers.<br />- Easy to use a Sharpie to write on the Mylar bag as to what the contents are.<br /><br />Cons:<br />- I wished these bags came with a ziplock type sealer. I have a work-around but would still prefer a ziplock sealer. When you use heat to seal it, you can reuse later, but then you have to cut the sealed part which in effect lowers the volumn over time that it can carry.<br /><br />TIP: On the center of Mylar bag, put some packing or scotch tape. This can be used to write what the contents are. When you resuse the Mylar bag, remove/replace the tape so you can re-label the contents of the bag.<br /><br />Final Conclusion: I would recommend these bags more if they had a ziplock like seal, especially at its current price point. Aside from using heat to seal, I fold several plies over and then seal with packaging tape.  I wished I could give a 4.5 star rating, but am only allowed to keep to whole numbers. With that, rounding down to a 4 overall.<br /><br />Disclaimer: Received this product for review under the Amazon Vine program.",1673619642441,0,false

Since the part that you can use for hook, it's not properly stitched fabric, it's multiple thin threads so overtime, it will worn out and I am not really sure it was the best structural design for the curtain. The fabric quality is actually superb, it's velvet without any muted tone, so it looks very exquisite. I love the fact that they used good quality fabric for curtain, but slightly disappointed with the hook parts.<br /><br />Functionality:<br /><br />Even though they don't explicitly mention, actually it works as blackout curtain (at least in my master bed room.) I believe it's due to the properly thick material, so I slept better from the first day that I have installed this. It also partially blocks coldness coming into the room and you can easily choose the length that you want. So I recommend it in terms of its unexpected functionality.<br /><br />Buy this if you need: a thick, light blocking curtain<br />Don't if you need: a sturdy curtain that has proper hook part",1678602731904,0,false
4,Not sure this worth the price but works well,"I know I will always go back to the original bottles and make the bathroom caddy look amazingly busy but since I moved to a new place, I try to make it look as tidy as possible, so I ordered them. Well, it's good but I think $17 for 3 plastic dispenser bottle is somewhat overpriced. So here is what I think.<br /><br />Build Quality and Design:<br /><br />So transparent bottle, transparent dispenser and sticker trio makes this product look nice and practical at the same time. Since you can constantly check the amount of the liquid inside, so it's easy to gauge how much product is left in your bottle. The bottle is square shaped so if it fits the caddy more efficiently as well.<br /><br />Functionality:<br /><br />The pump works pretty good and it applies good enough pressure so even if your products are highly viscous, it's likely dispense the liquid well.<br /><br />Cost:<br /><br />Despite of all the good things about this product, $17~18 something for 3 plastic bottle is not so appealing. Further, the container itself is not super thick, just normal bottle thickness. So I deducted one star from the review.<br />Despite of all the good things about this product, I think",1678167147139,0,false
4,"I am not sure why this product is positioned as oil spray, but works very well though.","Oil sprayers are popular due to the increasing popularity of the air-fryers or healthy cooking and I think this spray works well in that sense. It does spray oil relatively evenly (but not completely) but still, it works much better for the skincare or water spray purposes. I believe it's the viscosity since the nozzle is relatively small to make the finer mist.<br /><br />Build Quality and Design:<br />It has pretty large handle, so you can spray your whatever solution pretty good pressure. That includes the oil but it works wonders for skincare mist or toners. The white colored handle with transparent bottle is a good choice, since you can easily check out the cleanness of the bottle as well.<br /><br />Functionality:<br />As I mentioned above, it works better with the watery liquid rather than oil, and I am sure it's due to the viscosity and nozzle size. Yet, the oil is sprayed pretty well due to the high pressure exerted from the wide handle. But when the oil drops near the spray handle, it gets pretty slippery, becomes very annoying. Anyhow, it's good bottle to spray oil definitely.<br /><br />Buy this if you need: a good quality liquid spray. The bottle is transparent, so you can easily check out the solution.<br /><br />Don't if you need: a designated oil spray bottle and willing to pay more. There are much better solutions with higher price on Amazon.",1678165813504,1,false
4,Nice Quality but misleading color,"Shower curtains has two virtues - the design and functionality. It has nice pattern and color, it's good and it should prevent water splashing with material. So here is what I think.<br /><br />Build Quality & Design:<br /><br />I cannot deny this is well made shower curtain, since it's made with nice embossing pattern. But I think the photo is misleading, since it looks like it has beautiful gradient color but what I got is solid navy color. So make sure this is what you want before you buy. It looks like fabric rather than vinyl which is a good thing in terms of design and ambient.<br /><br />Functionality:<br /><br />It is made with water repellent material, so it doesn't get wet as other fabric looking curtains. It prevents water splash relatively well.<br /><br />Buy this if you need: a fabric looking shower curtain<br />Don't if you : were looking for gradient color pattern shower curtain. It comes with solid navy color in my case.",1677775160526,0,false
4,Totally not my style but still does its job,"If you or your lover love wine and can finish the whole bottle, then probably this stopper won't matter so much, also I don't think vacuum pump and seal for $20 something wine is totally extra. So wine stopper is a must item for me, to keep some wine at least ""psychologically fresh,"" Of course, it won't totally prevent the the wine being over-oxidized but still, it helps. So this is what I think.<br /><br />Build Quality & Design:<br />When we talk about being ""extra,"" this stopper is just an epitope of extra. It has golden - probably overly golden horse ornament on the top of stopper. If you like this kind of stuff, you will like it but it's really not my cup of tea. Practically, the horse doesn't look exquisite at all,  and it looks really gold sprayed looking without much sophistication.<br /><br />Functionality:<br /><br />But other than the obnoxious ornament, the rubber stopper part is made with 6 layers and it seals wine really well. I won't say it's like vacuum sealer, but still, it does what it is supposed to do. Because of this 6 layer rubber design, I gave 4 star review!<br /><br />Buy this if you want: a little overdone wine stopper<br />Don't if you like: simple, and modern looking wine stopper",1676511507149,0,false
4,Acceptable diffuser,"So, I love diffuser, it makes home looks more element and if it smells good, it enhances the ""feeling"" of space. This diffuser doesn't have anything additional as many other companies - such as flower corsages, beautiful ribbons and fancy packages but it does its job. So here is what I think.<br /><br />Ingredients:<br />So it's only made with 2 ingredients, denatured alcohol for diffusion and perfume. I am not really sure this is really made with the lavender oil, since it is only stated as perfume on the package.<br /><br />Scent:<br />It's not one of those warm-feeling lavender scent, it's rather on the cool side seemingly due to the alcohol solvent. I don't think I like this, but scent is very subjective so I won't talk more.<br /><br />Diffusion:<br />It emits scent surrounding area extremely well. It has many reeds and you can adjust the diffusion by adding / removing reeds.<br /><br />Buy this if you need: a lavender (with cool-touch) diffuser<br />Don't if you want: to use this as a gift. This is practically a home-use, no fancy packaging and not very visually appealing either.",1676149923377,0,false
4,Pretty cute but thin,"Okay, I don't know (or probably I know) what the non-food hot stuffs is coming in but anyhow this apron is really cute, and relatively well made for its purposes. So here is what I think.<br /><br />Build Quality & Design:<br />This is a apron with acceptable quality and neck string is actually adjustable. There are two strings attached to the apron, which you can make knot from the back. The color pair with dark brown and black color, and font in the front is somehow really - I don't know how to put this in words - interesting (some how cute, lol.) It does have pockets so it's very convenient as well.<br /><br />Functionality:<br />Seemingly, It's made with thin fabric and covered with plastic lining. Since they say it's grilling apron. I think it will protect you from the grease or sauces from the grill but if oil popping happens, I am not sure how this apron will protect you, since it's very thin.<br /><br />Buy this if you need: a fun apron for whatever purposes<br />Don't if you want: a thick and proper apron that can work as oil guard",1675525512289,0,false
1,Not sure whether this can be considered a good purchase,"Reusable shopping bags are cool and environmentally friendly and probably it's almost a must-have in NYC where plastic bags are charged by the supermarket. But many times, these reusable bags are distributed as promotional bags and it's not so hard to get them for free. So when you pay for the tote bags for shopping, you actually expected much better quality than thin unwoven fabric bags. Also, even though the stated the dimension, the picture is somewhat misleading. It's not as wide as it appears to be and practically, it's almost square shaped bag.<br /><br />Further, promotional shopping bags are cool but sometimes you don't want to carry around them because they are too colorful and ugly. Maybe that's the reason why you want to buy these. Yes, these bags fulfil this need since it's solid black bag,  yet they are very thin non-woven bags. It's hard to say this will be sturdy bags for the shopping. Stiches are fine for its price but it's way too thin.<br /><br />Final Thought: If you go to 99c store or supermarket, you get these bags for $0.99 or $1.99 and they have very comparable or better quality. I don't see any reasons to invest for them.",1675525015496,0,false
4,Candle without fragrance,"[[VIDEOID:eb82e270924690f7fae1e69c09e9179]] Okay to be honest, I thought this was a aroma candle but it's plain candle made with soy beeswax. I am not this was what I was looking, but it is beautiful candle with interesting geometric body. So here is what I think.<br /><br />Science:<br />So, there is near zero evidence that conventional candles release harmful or potentially harmful molecules into the air. This is a misleading claim, and there is absolutely no conclusive evidence that soy-beeswax candle can purify the air with statistically significant level. (I'm a researching scientist so I had to point this out.) So I think it's unfair for other candle producers, nor contribute to the health of general population, marketing with these claims.<br /><br />Esthetics:<br />It's a really beautiful candle comes with really beautiful box. They said this is hand-made as well, so I think it is a good collection to have it no matter what their claims are. That alone, I gave 3 stars.<br /><br />Another point:<br />So if you buy this product, they (or someone else probably) will plant one tree. I think it's really good concept if they really do. So I gave one more star. But since this product is so concerned about ""natural"", I wish they were a little more clear about their product source.<br /><br />Final:<br />AGAIN, there is NO EVIDENCE that paraffin candles release potentially dangerous molecules but this product is beautiful and they plant tree. I still think it's overpriced but it has beautiful packaging as well, so kept the 4 stars.",1674698602182,1,false
1,Grill without grilling,"[[VIDEOID:b41cf7d5aeef8c6dad79a8c029819a51]] I don't know how other Viners rated this product as 5 stars, probably I got the defective product. Anyhow, every manufacturer has different problems, but there is one thing that I really cannot stand. When the product that I have bought can't do the fundamental function, then it really bothers me. So here is what I think about this product.<br /><br />Build Quality & Design:<br />It has several design problem. First, the power cord is extremely short. I would say it's ~3 ft. It's almost impossible to connect this product if you are planning to eat something on the table. It comes with 8 plates, which are very cute though. It also comes with 8 very cute hard plastic spatula.The heat line is practically exposed to the outside, so it make around area very hot, further it doesn't heat the grill plate properly.<br /><br />Functionality:<br />Okay, I'm Korean and I know what the acceptable Korean grill level is. It doesn't heat the plate high enough temperature further it doesn't output enough energy. So as you can see from the video that I have attached (I heat the grill more than 10 min without putting food, then I began to grill), you can see the meat juice is boiling rather the meat is begin grilled. You know, whenever you see juice boiling, it's a warning sign, saying that you meat will taste bad. It has heat pipe and you put the grill plate on the top and bottom without any heat box as Philips smokeless grill has, then the heat will be radiated into air, and practically very little heat will be transferred to the grill. So at the end of the day, you end up with low temperature grill, resulting in bad meat. Further, due to the same problem, it dries out rather than cook on the small plates below the heat pipe due to the same reason.<br /><br />Buy this if you need: to boil your food for whatever reason. I was really excited to see the grill on my list but.. this is a big disappointment.<br />Don't if you need: to really grill the meat. At the end of the day, I had to redo everything in my stove grill.",1674343518817,0,false
4,Really Cute Ramen Bowl with lots of pros,"[[VIDEOID:3eb64e2d3e41a02345eac0874f433c07]] This is an absolutely adorable microwavable ramen bowl with pretty good build quality, I just hope that the company was a little more informative. So here is what I think.<br /><br />Build Quality & Design:<br />This one is pretty sturdy with solid build quality. It doesn't have much offsets. It consists of 3 parts - bowl, lid  and chopstick which you can assemble. According to the seller, the lid is also microwavable. The chopstick is as long as proper chopstick after assembly, which is good, it's not one of those really short ones.  Both of bowl and lid are made with solid plastic, and somewhat sturdy. There is a silicone cap that you can open and close, so you can open it for release pressure and drain water after you boil stuffs. It's pretty cool and useful idea I think.  So I don't have much complain about the build quality.<br /><br />Functionality:<br />It does boil things pretty well. I test-boiled water for 5 min with this to check out whether the lid and silicone parts and container would deform or not. It boiled water nicely without any deformation and also no weird / chemical smell nor the coloring leakage to water. The handle remained just slightly warm while the container became boiling hot. This is a pretty impressive.<br /><br />Chemical Safety:<br />I wish that the seller made sure whether this container is bisphenol A (BPA) free or not, since it doesn't come with any manual, instructions/ Further, it doesn't state whether this product has any QC certificates. I will change this review to 5 star, if the seller provides information on these concerns.<br /><br />Buy it if you need: a dorm, small apartment and microwave friendly container for your Shin Ramyeon<br />Don't if you : need to make sure all the safety certificate",1672873488271,1,false
4,Super Fun!,"This bubble waffle machine works really well and is fairly easy to assemble; just a few screws needed to attach the handle. The bubble waffles get really crispy when they cool or you can use less oil and have a cakier waffle. You can set the temperature and the timer to suit your needs. You do need a looser batter that you can squeeze out of a bottle to really handle the process correctly. With that saying, if you're using gluten free flour with zanthan gum in it, it will make the batter too thick if you're planning on using the included recipe. It definitely works with gluten free flour (picture is a GF waffle) but it's a little difficult to spread across the waffle maker surface due to the thickness of the batter and using only one hand to do it. That was the only real issue I encountered; it would be really awesome if it had the ability to stay open without having to manually hold it open so you have more flexibility with the batter texture but overall it's well built and definitely suitable for commercial use. A Nice Product!",1677717947878,0,false
3,Works Decently!,"This Britech stick vacuum works pretty well but the unit is made of cheap plastic. The buttons you press to remove the attachments stick and make it very difficult to remove from the holder. The battery runs out fairly quickly but it does have decent suction and charges up quickly so. It's lightweight and easy to maneuver so would be good for an older person to use. The waste canister is fairly easy to empty and replace. It's a decent value for the money but definitely could be a lot better with some changes to the release buttons. It's easy to change between the floor vacuum and the handheld but as I said, the release buttons can be an annoying issue at times.",1674944286938,0,false
4,Makes Great Nut Milks!,So far I've made hemp and almond milk in this machine and it's done a great job. I gave it 4 stars because it does jump around just a little when the cycle starts so it needs some improvement in that way. It also could be a little larger; it only makes about 2 cups at a time. Overall the unit worked great and it only took about 5 minutes per batch of milk. The recipe book is simple and flexible. It's very cost effective to make your own non-dairy milks and this machine makes it possible to do just about any kind you want. It has room temp as well as heat settings for things like rice milk. I do wish it was bigger and possibly more affordable for the general public but it's a great machine. We love It!,1674598024392,0,false
4,Nice Set but Not Very Thick!,"This set works for the bathroom but it wasn't at all what I thought it would be. It's more of a thinner memory foam type material rather than a typical bathroom rug; thus it has the ability to absorb liquid. They're nice but could be a little thicker so they lay nicer on the floor and feel good on the feet. The shower curtain is also thin but works fine, a plastic lining is a good idea and needed. The seat cover is strapped on with a couple of straps and only covers the top of the seat but It's very pretty and does the job. A Decent Value!",1672971106312,0,false
4,Nice Water Pitcher!,"This water pitcher is pretty nice. It's a combination of plastic and glass so it's durable enough.

It wouldn't fit in mine but I'm going to use it to serve water or drinks to company by filling it with ice and keeping it on the table so it still works for us. I don't like that the lid isn't spill proof but they do tell you this in the product description. it's easy to clean and comes with a nice, long brush to reach inside of it. If you need a very large pitcher for ice tea at Bbqs, this is the one you need. A Good Product and Decent Value!",1672968868631,0,false

4,Nice aroma but pricey,"[[VIDEOID:6b6726e1551bb0ba1b3287d55bf070a3]] This is a good quality product. I have been using this in my home office and it smells great. It is not overpowering but just about right. I have used many brands with different essential oils over the years, and this one is different; it smells of whitewood scent, sandalwood, cedarwood, & mint. I am a big fan of lavender essential oil and vanilla brands, but I still like this. The key is I use fresh Reed sticks every three days because after the sticks get saturated with essential oil, their diffusing capacity to transpire decreases. The fresh and dry sticks transpire essential oil from the bottle and diffuses from the top of the sticks. It is a simple mechanism. My only grip is that this product is way too pricey. I bought essential oil diffusers for half the price of this product and still smelled great.",1678497242177,0,false

The product description states that this does not produce aroma like “Indian incense.” On the positive, the sticks burn well without interruptions, and for the first fifteen minutes of burning it gives a sense of good energy without any smoke. The incense sticks don’t have a stem that makes it challenging to use with an incense stick holder. The package did not have an incense stick holder.

It shows you can stack them and they do fit together to do so, but as these are a bit pricey with regard to the rough advertised price point-- it would cost more than I'm willing to raise up higher than an inch and a half. I do believe if you only need to raise up that much this is likely an acceptable cost but there are other products that would make it more cost effective if you intended to stack more of these, or if a larger ""rise"" was needed.",1678643487250,0,false
4,Nice budget fixed angle sharpening system & can be made excellent with mods,"I have the RX-008 (previous model) and so am comparing it to that in addition to overall use. I have used this a number of times and while very familiar with the ruixin sharpeners can't say I'm quite an expert on this one yet.<br /><br />So these in general (previous model and this one) are a great value, though at the expense of them needing some minor adjustments and modifications to really be excellent. If you know that going in to it, they are great and 5-10 times less expensive than some of the other fixed angle sharpeners. The issue is-- you have to figure it out on your own or watch a bunch of YouTube videos. The manual is excellent for basic sharpening technique and the overall idea behind it but isn't very helpful in hands on use of the product imo.<br /><br />There have been a few improvements (metal ball instead of a nylon/plastic one, hinge to set the sharpening arm on, clamp, etc). The only one I'm not quite sold on as far as ""upgrades"" is the clamp. I was so familiar and had modified the previous one to where it was exactly where it needed to be, with the same angle regardless of the side you flipped it to. On this one it seems like I don't quite have the clearance to make the adjustment (a shim) that I had on the previous 008 model. I'll figure out the best way to do this eventually, but this is one of the reasons I say I'm not quite an expert yet. I had purchased 3rd party add ons for my 008 model ruixin pro, so it is definitely nice that this new model came with some of those things already.<br /><br />Overall, this is an excellent value but will need some correcting and adjustments right out of the gate. Watch YouTube videos (the previous model ones apply to this also) as there are some really good ones on setting angles and using it in general. You will need to watch a few at least as there isn't just one that covers it all from my experience. This is capable of producing excellent edges, and even re-profiling but you will need a bit of knowledge to get it there. I put mirror edges now on the knives I want to (not all) with this and am able to keep it set to where I like with only minor adjustments needed here and there, but it can take a bit to get it there.<br /><br />This would easily be a 5 star product if it didn't need all the corrections. It can be a 5 star sharpener, but you have to do some work to get it there!",1677968599961,1,false
4,Not using for decoration but as sketch books they work well,"I go through a lot of sketch books. I have a lot of them, of varying quality and price. I always pick them up when I see them as I know they will be used.<br /><br />These are good for that purpose. The paper isn't really all that thick/heavy and so would really only be suitable for dry media but it is good for sketches. The binding on these is great and rivals a good, quality hardcover book and should certainly hold up over time.  Typically, hardcover sketchbooks can be a bit pricey so to get so many pages, with a larger page size ends up being a good deal at roughly $10 per book. Would be nice if they offered them with blank covers for those using these as sketchbooks, but I still recommend overall!",1675649437285,0,false
3,"Easy enough for me to assemble, though sub-par materials means this is a let-down for me","I really wanted to like this little desk as it is small and compact and the writing surface can go up or down. I had no problems putting together as there wasn't a lot of pieces and it was fairly self explanatory for me. The issue I had is with a really light weight metal and cheap chipboard used and no further reinforcing. When tightening screws into the support arms as an example, to get them tight means either the metal is deforming due to the tension of the wood it is screwing into directly and is visibly at risk of shattering (as evidence by it bending and even lightly cracking). I ended up loosening the screws as it was apparent it couldn't take being tightened without ultimately breaking. So, to tighten 90% of the screws that this uses they have to be less than tight and looser then normal to avoid damage to the desk. Obviously this isn't ideal and better materials or simply reinforcing the holes with a metal backing/bracing would've helped immensely. The other issue is once completely put together (again, as tight as I was able to get the screws without causing visible deformities (and structural issues)) the top section with the writing surface is connected to the same cheap metal tubes that slide into the lower section so to say this is sturdy is an exaggeration. It has two knobs that you tighten to have a bolt press into that cheap support arm metal and that is all that is supporting the top writing surface. This is also the party that allows you to""adjust"" it at a higher or lower level but as there are no indents or holes that you are able to set it at those hand tightened bolts that press into the metal tubes will likely not be real durable over time (and just isn't a great system to adjust the heaviest part of the table to begin with). Even slightly better materials and some reinforcing would've done wonders with this so it really is a shame. I'll likely continue to use but am certainly nervous about putting any weight on it or moving it or adjusting it at all, and that shouldn't be the case for something that is only used for writing or with a lightweight laptop. If it was made better and more durable it would be a good value, but as it stands it is certainly being listed for more than it is worth, in my opinion.",1675013206140,0,false
4,"Fairly well made, small portable grinder","I'm using this to fill the refillable style k-cup type pods. Even to fill these it takes a while. So it certainly is only suited to small amounts and anything larger is going to take a while, though doable. This appears to be made well, but the only thing I'm not a huge fan of is the fit as there is definitely some play with the hand crank and each piece. For the hand crank, we shall see if it lasts but if it does, this is just a ""feel"" issue as it makes it not seem as solid/sturdy or premium. I will update if this changes prematurely or ceases to function as a result. Otherwise, up to this point and through numerous uses it is working well.",1674171352564,0,false
3,Not a fan of this scent,"While this has a high price tag, you get a lot and it is quite strong. A little goes a looooong way. So it is probably a decent deal IF you like the scent. I unfortunately found that I do not. I have a hard time rating this poorly simply because of the scent but it is quite synthetic smelling. I have to agree with others, this very much has that old lady perfume smell to it. There's no getting around it. This slightly sweet cloying outdated musk smell unfortunately just smells cheap. I wanted to like it, and even mixed it in various concentrations with other essential oils but could only smell this as it overpowers near any other scent. It is unfortunate, as I have so much now, and seems like it would be a good value.",1673672451594,0,false
4,Well Made and Beautiful,This is a beautifully crafted organizer.<br />It has a compartments for all of the plastic baggies that I use.  I like the cutter for parchment paper.<br /><br />I like that it has the option to mount it on the wall and comes with mounting hardware.,1676938152978,0,false
4,Simple and Cute Organization,"I like the simple design of this hair claw organizer.  I have quite a few large hair claws, and this organizer can hold a lot of them.  The dowels are sturdy and just wide enough to hold many widths and sizes of hair claws.  I really like the swivel clips for holding scarves and bandanas.<br /><br />I only wish that there were some type of end caps to prevent the dowels from sliding out of the loops.  I think it would give it a more finished look.",1676205006939,0,false
4,Decent Scale... Batteries Included,"This is a pretty nice scale for the kitchen.  It isn't bulky and is easy to store.  Three AAA batteries are included for immediate use.  There is also an app to help with weight loss and provide nutritional information for many different foods.  The app is easy enough to use, but I don't think I will be using it as much since I already have an app for weight loss.",1675034393606,0,false
4,Pretty...Not sure If It Really Works,"This is a nicely packaged and beautifully designed deodorizer.  It is really small making it easy to keep it hidden in your refrigerator, closet or any small space you want to freshen up.<br /><br />It's too early to tell if it is working, but the area doesn't have a bad odor, so maybe it is.  🤔",1672866708461,0,false
4,Cute cover,"Very cute tissue box cover.  I love daisies so I just had to add this to my house.  It is sturdily made, though it is a very tight fit over a kleenex (and yes I used an actual kleenex brand box to test).  It was quite hard to get on, I wasn't even sure I was going to be able to make it fit without smashing the box some.<br />The seams don't seem exactly straight either, which didn't help with getting it on.  No matter how I try to adjust the corners just don't align on the top and the bottom.<br />But it is cute.",1678387724015,0,false
4,Soft and smooth,"Nice pillow overall.  I was surprised how soft it was considering how heavy and dense it felt.  I prefer softer pillows and usually sleep with several.  But I'm pretty good with just this one alone most nights.  It is a queen size pillow which I love, as it leaves plenty of room for my head and most often a cat too.<br />The cover it comes with is very soft.  It zips off so is washable, but I will still be putting a pillow case on it for protection.<br />I definitely don't feel it is a ""cooling"" pillow.  Have woken up several times quite warm from it.  But nothing worse than any other pillow I've ever tried",1677724092028,1,false
3,Too firm for me,These pillows look and feel nice to the touch. They appear well made so i expect they would hold up well to nightly use. They look super fluffy in the pictures but they are actually very dense and heavy and quite firm. I do prefer a softer pillow so I honestly didn't like these at all. I woke up with neck and shoulder pain after trying to sleep on them.<br />They are great for propping me up to read or watch TV in bed but definitely not gonna work for me for sleep. If you like a firmer pillow They may be a good choice.,1677688720287,1,false
4,Comfy and warm,"Pretty plush down comforter.  It is a beautiful gray color which matches my bedroom décor perfectly. I can tell it is made from real goose feathers because my cats were all SUPER interested as soon as I put it on the bed.  Didn't get much sleep because they would not leave it alone, and it has been their favorite sleeping place since.<br />It isn't very thick but still provides plenty of warmth while being light as a feather...pun intended.  The fabric that covers it is thick and sturdy.  Took the onslaught of kitty claws and teeth without any damage being done. My only complaint is that the fabric is stiff and rough.  Not soft at all.  Hoping with some use it will soften up because right now I really don't like the feel of it on my skin. So I've put a fuzzy blanket between it and me and for now that will do.",1673402293101,0,false
4,Sturdy silicon spatulas,"Well, I can't speak to how they work for cooking, but they work great for soap and candlemaking!  The handles are nice and strong.  Very little give in them.  The spatula blades are still firm but flexible enough to go easily around curved jars and buckets.  They are bigger than I expected, which is nice for what I need them for.<br />Clean up easily and appear to be holding up well even after multiple uses today.  A great addition to my crafting toolkit!",1673401627142,1,false
4,Big and soft but doesn't stay put,This is a very nice large soft cover. It fits my over stuffed couch perfectly and gives great coverage of the surface from my dog. It comes with a big strap to help hold it in place. However I have not figured out how to make the strap work with my couch. My top/back cushions are attached to the frame. And I assume (as there are no instructions) that it is supposed to go around them?  So it is a little wiggling than is ideal. And ironically my dog doesn't seem to like it that much and hasn't spent much time on the couch since I put it on. But it looks nice and feels nice.,1673323547663,0,false
4,Pretty and solid shelves,Nice solid wood for sure. These little shelves are heavy so you can tell they aren't made with your typical clean press board. The laminate on it is beautiful. A little lighter than I had hoped but very nice nonetheless. Very solid brackets. The wood did crack a bit when I screwed the screws in (which I did by hand) but it was completely hidden by the brackets.<br />My only gripe is the cheap anchors. I've used a lot of plastic anchors. I know how they are supposed to work. These fell into the wall as soon as I started screwing in the screw. Thankfully one bracket of each shelf is in a stud so still nice and sturdy and I am not using the shelf for anything heavy. So just a heads up you might want better anchors if that will not be the case for you.,1673323309649,0,false
4,"Perfect size, easy to use","Works as intended! Melts well/easily, and each scent has a nice aroma. However, the scents smell fairly similar to me (probably because they're all packaged together.<br />I highly recommend Classic Wax Melts - 16 Highly Scented Wax Melts in a Presentation Gift Box for someone that wants a pleasant heart-shaped wax melt for their home!",1677295700700,1,false
3,"Not soft, smelt like burnt plastic, lots of fuzz after the first wash.","Despite others reviews, my set came completely the opposite (in a bad way). I got the gray set, and was super excited to use some new, soft towels. That didn't happen.<br />First off, after taking them from the box, removing the bag, they stunk. Like burnt plastic stink.. I HAD TO wash them, because no way was I about to use that on my clean body.<br />Secondly, after washing (cold, light detergent, low spin), and I threw them in the dryer (low heat, light tumble, fabric sheet)... there was so much lint. I am not certain that is normal, but it shed worse than my husky in the middle of July. They aren't losing any stitching, tassels, but it must have been there - somewhere. I know the lint I saw in the catcher was from it because I clean it before each dryer use.<br />Thirdly, they are thin. This might be a good thing in terms of drying times (after bath/shower and leaving on a rack).. but we're talking see-through thin.<br /><br />So overall I am not happy, and I would not recommend INK+IVY Nova 100% Cotton Terry Bath Towel Set. The other reviewers like it, so it is possible I just got a defect. Hopefully so.",1674958480131,0,false
4,"Beautiful knife, sharp, large, but missing protective sleeve.","This knife is excellent. It is super sharp, has a great angle on the edge of the blade to encourage a smooth rock or slide on a cutting board. It has a nice handle that fits well in my Medium/Large hand, and the pattern on the blade is cool. It comes in a nice box, a plastic tip protector on the tip near the handle, and the point at the front of the knife.<br />My only complaint is that it didn't come with some sort of sleeve for storage.. It would look best on one of those magnetic strips on the wall of a kitchen, but unless kept in the box, it would be extremely dangerous, loose in the kitchen-utensil drawer.<br />So, I would highly recommend this ""cleaver viking chopping vegetable knife: meat cleaver-chef kitchen butcher damascus knife"" - but be aware that you will need to either keep it in the box, buy a sleeve, or use a magnetic strip to place it on the kitchen wall!",1674701634486,0,false
4,"Good quality, difficult to separate","These came in a nice box, suitable for retail packaging.  The spoons were hooked together in a storage position.  It was difficult to separate them but I managed.  Once you hooked them up in use position, they do separate easily.<br />The quality is very good, nice and sturdy.  The plastic bends perfectly upon a squeeze.  I appreciate the silicone insert on the solid spoon side as it makes it easier to grab things.  I had them in the dishwasher and they came out like new.  I would recommend these but with a caveat that you store them in use position or separately.",1677255117820,0,false
3,Good board but damaged and with one major flaw,"The board was shrink wrapped in such a way as to create permanent wrinkles on the cover that did not go away even after some ironing was done on it.  Also, the cover is somewhat thin.  Either way, we’ll need to replace it at some point in time.<br />The board itself is nice, with many features as described.  Especially like the pullout iron holder that also functions great as a cloth hanger.<br />A major flaw is the lack of height.  Even in the highest position the board is just not high enough for our comfort.  Also, the board is rather a poor value for what you get.",1676470106970,0,false
4,Very nice but not much cooling,"We have gel foam cooling mattress toppers on two other queen size beds and they do have a cooling effect.  I was expecting something similar from this product as it’s being advertised as a cooling pad.<br />It was nicely vacuum packaged although too much plastic for my standard.  It recovered to its full thickness immediately.  The fit was perfect, and the deep pockets worked great on our 18” thick mattress.  The topper is very soft to touch and to sleep on however, it does not provide nearly as much cooling as a gel foam product.  But it does represent a good value as compared to foam products.",1676469286828,2,false
4,"Nice box, missing shoulder strap and ice pack","The box itself is good, durable on the outside and inside.  We loved the Tiffany Blue color – definitely stylish.  You will not go wrong with this box but be aware of two demerits.<br />First of all, all the soft boxes we’ve ever used had a should strap.  It’s just so much easier to carry to a car race, when the box is full of cans and bottles.<br />Second, it does not come with an ice pack.  A one pack would be enough to have a complete set, ready to go.  I realize it is an additional cost but in my opinion worthy of adding.",1674487099324,0,false
4,"Well made, super sharp","This is a very well made device, especially for what it will be used for.  All the pieces assemble with a precision, the handle has a very useful grip, and the length is perfect for a camp fire.<br />There is nothing to complain about except for the extremely sharp ends – why would I need the ends to be that sharp?  All it does is makes this thing dangerous to handle.  So I had to take away one star for that.",1674486453928,0,false
3,High quality but too high and too hard,"I’m a total side sleeper and always used shallow and soft pillows that allow my head to contour easily.  The description mentions it being soft and cozy memory foam.  We have mattress topers that are also soft and made out of memory foam so was looking for similar experience.<br />Unfortunately I didn’t last past 5 minutes.  My neck was sore and the entire pillow was just too high for my comfort.  My wife tried it last night and had same results and comments.  The foam density is too high, which is also why the pillow is heavy.<br />I have to give it credit for being a high quality item, both the foam and the case.",1674481323279,0,false
3,Beautiful!,"These pillow covers are absolutely beautiful!<br /><br />In preparation to wash these pillow covers, I found you need to hand wash them.<br /><br />I knew immediately they would lose a lot of dye therefore, should not be washed in the machine.<br /><br />Unfortunately, I decided not to use these pillow covers since they require too much care with handwashing.<br /><br />If you are a patient person and have the time to hand wash occasionally, definitely try them.",1674317956332,0,false
4,Almost gave it 5 stars,"The cabinet came in a double box, very well packaged and protected inside.  All the pieces were immaculate and marked with an ID sticker.<br />The instructions were straightforward and complete.  All the hardware pieces were of high quality and marked well.  The pre-drilled holes were perfect until I started to install the doors with hinges on the cabinet.  Clearly the holes were spaced too far apart and I was just able to fit the hinges/doors onto them – but barely.  This was surprising as all the other holes matched up perfect.<br />Overall the cabinet is nice and will be functional for us.  But I just couldn’t give it a perfect score due to the mismatched holes.",1674133934179,1,false
3,Not heavy enough to stay in one place,This paper towel holder suits it purpose.<br /><br />It isn’t heavy enough to stay in place.  I expected to be heavy due to it being stainless steel and the description indicated it had a heavy bottom/weighted base.<br /><br />The arm on it really doesn’t help much in the way that it should help tear off a sheet but you need to hold the top so the holder doesn’t tip over.,1673465025791,1,false
3,"Questionable performance, poor value",The product is quite attractive looking and packaged in a nice box.  It also has a functional rubber pad on the bottom.<br />I installed it in our freezer about a week ago.  At this point I cannot tell the difference/improvement from the baking soda we usually use for this purpose.  Maybe it needs a longer time for it to work.<br />But the biggest demerit is the cost – too high for what is suppose to do.  That’s why the three stars.,1672688933656,0,false
3,"Pain to assemble, finished product is fine","First off, the OEM packaging was terrible.  Thin cardboard was not able to protect Styrofoam which was in pieces.  What a mess!  And the box weighted a ton.<br />One panel was chipped at the corner, and another one (J) looked like it was used before.<br />There are very many screws and I would not recommend using the supplied screwdriver – you almost must have a power driver/drill to assemble this dresser.  Even using the power drill, it took me 3 hours to finish the job.<br />The assembly instructions were good and straightforward, but there was one incorrectly labeled piece (panel Q was labeled as G).  Supplied fasteners were very good, with some extra pieces.  Some predrilled holes were not exactly matching the hardware but I made it work.  And not sure why the instructions say “Six drawer locker” since there are only four drawers and none of them lock.  Weird.<br />The dresser looks good, although the drawers do not operate smoothly.  It’s also somewhat cumbersome to open the drawers using these slots.",1672687688421,0,false
4,Nice pouches for snacks!,"This is a nice pouch for repackaging snacks. It is just a small bag which is good for cereals, nuts and small quantity food items. The paper is made of good and durable quality material and not flimsy. This pack contains 50 pouches which is a good deal.",1679041054314,0,false
3,All Ice Cube Molds Are Not The Same,"I already own a pair of nice square ice cube molds, and got this set to be able to get rid of a couple of aging plastic ice cube trays in the freezer.  I though that since the picture looked identical to the ice cube mold I already own, that these were going to be the same.  I was wrong.  These are of significantly lesser quality.<br /><br />These mold will work, and they did produce nice square ice cubes, but the silicone they are made out of is rather on the thin side, making them rather flimsy and wobbly.  The lids fit on, but unlike my other set, these lids tend to fall off, and it is difficult to fill and transport these to the freezer.  My other set I can fill, put the lids on, stack on top of one another, and carry the stack to the freezer.  These I need to put on a tray and put the whole tray into the freezer - trying to pick up a mold after it is filled resulted in the water spilling out.<br /><br />While these will work, they are not of the best quality.  The ice cubes they produce are the same, but their flimsy nature adds additional work at getting them frozen.",1679070775787,0,false
4,Decent Pasta Roller For The Home Chef,"I have seen profession pasta rollers - both hand crank and machine types - used by professional chefs.  This is not like them, but it does a decent job for home use.  I understood when ordering this that it does not have a cutter attachment - I am ok with that.  It rolls the dough easily and quickly, which is usually the tiresome and time consuming part of pasta making.  The dough is rolled evenly, and I am quite happy at the  way it works.<br /><br />I have already used this twice - once to make a pumpkin/sage flat noodle that we tossed with toasted pumpkin seeds and olive oil, and the other time to make an excellent thick flat dumpling for cooking with chicken.  Both times this device was a time saver and I appreciate it already.<br /><br />It is relatively easy to clean, just be sure not to put it in the dishwasher.<br /><br />A decently made pasta roller that is suitable for home use.",1678902626078,0,false
4,"Fluffy & Soft, Like Little Cloud Pillows To Lay Upon","Received this, placed it in the wash (like all new clothing items, it is wise to wash before using), and gently dried in a low temp dryer.  It arrived vacuum packed and quite condensed, but fluffed and became like little pillows of cloud after washing/drying.<br /><br />As they are marketing it as a mattress topper, it could have been a little thicker.  But since I was using it as a mattress pad, it worked well.  Do not think you are adding any significant layer to your mattress with this item - it merely adds a fluffy layer to the top, and helps gives a way for air to circulate as you lay on it.  The pad is soft and fluffy, but compresses quickly when it has a weight (i.e. person) laying on it.<br /><br />Still, for its cost, it is a rather nice mattress pad.  It has deep sides and fit even my rather thick mattress with its topper pad.  The side material is stretchy, but could be a bit stronger - its holds well, so I cannot really complain.  Perhaps not a luxury & top of the line item, but well worth what it costs.<br /><br />I am using this as a mattress pad, and it works well.  It is soft and fluffy, giving a soft layer on top of my bedding.",1673630555289,0,false
1,Gaonala TV Tray TV Table,"This TV tray is not very sturdy at all. It wobbles and tips over way too easily. Fortunately it was easy to assemble, because the instructions were for a different model.

4,Easy to use,"The product itself is quick and easy to use.  Works exactly as would expect.<br /><br />The product shown online looks a bit nicer quality than the one received. Perhaps once it is filled with clips, hats and scarves it won’t look so flimsy.  It’s not bad quality by any means, but the macrame could be better. I probably will only use this in my closet for that reason.<br /><br />Definitely helps eliminate clutter and helps me better see what all hair clips I have!<br /><br />No assembly required.  Pull it out of the box and hang. That’s all there is to it!  Easy!<br /><br />Online description indicates it can hold 20 to 24 claw clips. I think that estimate is accurate.<br /><br />Definitely keeps things organized and reduces clutter. Definitely easy to use. Could be slightly better quality especially given the price. A bit expensive for what it is.",1675999585307,0,false
2,Poor craftsmanship…..see photos,The Ziploc organizer box functions as it should. The reason for my rating is the poor craftsmanship. The photos showed numerous examples of how it was poorly made.

The only not so positive comment would be in order to refill the container I have to take the storage box out of the drawer, slide the entire lid off, refill, put the lid back on and insert back into the drawer. Would be much easier if the top popped off instead of slid off and the container could stay in the drawer when it needed to be refilled.

4,Good quality & look nicer than a plastic storage version,"These plastic bag storage containers are nicely made. They are fair priced and look more expensive than they actually are.<br /><br />One of the 2 boxes requires very minimal “assembly”. Pop a divider in place and slide the back cover on. Easy as that!<br /><br />The only item I do not like is when it comes time to refill one of the boxes you have to remove the entire box from your drawer, slide the back cover off, fill, and then put back in the drawer.  The second box you fill from the front and it can remain in the drawer when you refill.<br /><br />This would make an inexpensive and cute housewarming gift for someone.<br /><br />Good quality product for a fair price.",1673652301371,0,false
2,Under the counter / suction cup Mount doesn’t work,I ordered this specifically to mount underneath my cupboards. It will not stay mounted with the suction cups provided. There is not a way to permanently mount it. I like the idea of it not being permanently mounted and that’s why I ordered it. The suction cups are very small and don’t provide enough “stay power”. Otherwise it works well. Unfortunately though I wanted this specific item for the under the counter mount and that does not work.<br /><br />Disappointing…..,1672868367292,0,false

There are smaller screws,  which I guess help to better secure the metal prongs from under the shelf,  but I didn't use those.  I'm using the shelf to hold lightweight rubber ducks that I collect,  so I didn't see any particular sturdiness issues.

3,"Does a decent job, good for dust and basic jobs","This is less powerful than the old school “Dustbuster”, but of course is also less expensive. I like that it comes with a carrying case, and that it is rechargeable. The charge happens overnight, not in 2 hours as claimed. The main attachment has a bit more suction than the brush attachment, but the brush can loosen pet hair. I tried this on the floor and on furniture. I found that I had to empty it frequently, even after a small amount of dust or debris. The filter worked well, and I’m glad there is a spare. I wish the suction were at least a little stronger. I didn’t think it was as loud as some folks made it out to be, but it isn’t quiet. I like that I can bring it to work and vacuum up those nooks and crannies that need some attention. I’m also happy to use the brush attachment for the inside of my piano, which needs a gentler vacuum than average. Perfectly suitable to vacuum up the floor of your car.",1678074452741,0,false
4,Cute for an event!,"These are cute napkins. I like that they are separated into two packages of 16, so they can be stored easily. They aren’t the highest quality, but the print is very nice. There are slight white edges, so this package is possibly priced a couple dollars more than I would want to pay for this set.  The napkins are also thin. For comparison, I often purchase the colored dinner napkins from IKEA. They don’t have this gorgeous print though, so the starry night theme is worth it!",1675282242292,0,false

2,"Easy to put together, cheap materials for the cost, Very disappointed","My new ""dresser"" had very good instructions and well marked parts that allowed me to put this together in about 1 hour, which was OK. This dresser has a lower quality look and feel that is extremely light duty, which was disappointing for the cost/value and what I was expecting. The drawers are thin cardboard-like walls covered with cheap material, and fall out easily when pulled out, which I do not like. I was expecting wood drawer fronts, but the fronts are wood design faux wood, and was disappointing. The dresser itself is very unstable and needs to be secured to the wall with included wall straps and mount, without which this is unsafe around my kids. The materials such as laminated pressboard wood, and fabric covered cardboard material drawers gives it a cheap feel for me, which I did not like nor expect. The drawers are acceptable for my underwear and socks, which is OK. There is a nice touch of a power jack with 2 usb-C ports that attaches to the top shelf, which i do like. I tested the USB-C ports and they do in fact charge my cell phone well, which I like.

I am lacking a working drill at the moment so the provided glue mounting is what I used, it took 72hrs to fully cure, as expected and works well. I usually use mounting screw method, which tends to be very secure, so Long term security if the glue mounting I used is to be determined. The glass is darkened glass and has a quality look and feel and fair Kung heavy duty, which is appealing to me. The kit came with everything I needed to Mount the shelves and was not missing any parts, which I liked. The shelves look very nice on my wall next to my office desk.

The unit is easy for me to hold in my hand with its handle, as it is approx the size my large travel mugs, which is appealing as well compared to my larger kettle.

There is plenty of water storage which allows for plenty of work time.<br />I love how many different attachments there are, because it makes this a versatile machine! The function and Versatility is my favorite part about it. It works great!<br /><br />Cons:<br />I wish that it came with more than one microfiber pad. It takes more than one pad to clean a large room.<br />The way that some of the attachments clip together seems like it will not last for many years if it is used often or rough.

It does have a flap to keep stuffing out of the zipper...so, you can add stuffing as is needed?<br /><br />They arrive vacuum sealed and immediately puff up upon opening, however, they don't get close to the advertised photos.

4,Good storage bags,"I tried out one of the jumbo bags. I put 3 very large, fluffy,  oversized, decorative bed pillows inside. It took a few tries to zip the bag because the tab would pop off.

Start at one end and make sure to line up the zippers just as you would on any ziplock bag you're sealing by hand, squeeze the tab, and pull it all the way across to the other end. I screwed the pump onto the opening, and began pumping out the air. This wasn't nearly as quick and easy as using a vacuum, but it did work.  I kept switching arms to do the pumping, and yes the jumbo bag took a few minutes, but the set up functioned for me as it was described.<br /><br />I'm sure the smaller size bags will go faster, but I wanted to see how difficult it would be with the largest size first.

It could hold a very small cheese ball and a handful of crackers. The only way I could see this becoming part of my holiday table decor is putting gumdrops on it to make it look like a lighted tree. The size of it isn't really conducive for much else.<br /><br />If I were to see this item in a store, I would expect a price tag of $8-$10.

There's no way they would support a curtain that weighs over 6 lbs.

2,nearly impossible to get exact amount of grind,"My wife got this grinder via some rewards ""points"" at her work, so we didn't get it at Amazon, but since I do all my product reviews here, I wanted to do the same for this grinder.  Normally I would not even have bothered to write one, but this grinder just grinds me the wrong way :-(<br /><br />For starters, the users guide and assembly instructions are completely useless.  You get a manual that tells you, in n languages, pretty much nothing you need to know.  For instance, the top part of the burr grinding mechanism comes as a separate piece that is supposed to ""latch"" into the grinder - but the fit is either terrible (it doesn't slide in very far) or that's just how far it's supposed to go!?  I twisted it as far as I could and moved on without much confidence.<br /><br />Grind amount precision - or should I say the lack thereof.  The only control you have is time-based, but because the timer wheel has no explicit notches or even labels smaller than 5 second intervals, it's next to impossible to find the number of table spoons you need for the amount of coffee you're brewing.  It's a guessing game.  Once you have the setting right, you're good to go - but god forbid you need to switch between two different amounts like I do: in the mornings, I need to brew enough for me and my wife while the rest of the day, it's a single serving for me.  After several weeks, I have yet to find a way to get the strength of the coffee right.  Terrible.<br /><br />And once you have the grind, getting it all out of the glass container is a chore too because of the ridiculous amount of static electricity present.  Bodum tries to make a point out of telling its future customer how its glass containers are better than plastic ones at controlling static - but  my cheap camping burr grinder with its plastic grind container produces next to no static and  I don't have to use a little brush to get it all out like I do with the Bodum.  I'm wondering if it has to do with the speed (the camp grinder is much slower) or the material (the camp grinder uses a ceramic burring mechanism whereas the Bodum uses stainless steel)?  Either way, there's always a mess due to the static electricity.<br /><br />I just ordered another Burr grinder that'll hopefully do a better job than this one.  I'll keep this one for emergencies.",1677424310744,0,false
3,Good ideas - poorly implemented,"On the positive side, this is a large room divider, providing plenty of privacy at 7’ tall and 10’ long.  Also, the curtain cloth used seems of high quality and the hangers move the curtain easily.  Another nice touch are the magnets in the end of the courts in, which keep the curtain attached at the end poles.<br /><br />But now the negatives: the product arrived with no assembly instructions, making installation unnecessarily difficult.  Worse, the 4 bases don’t have any kind of groove for where they attach to the horizontal bottom pipe.  So no matter how tight you make the screw from the pipe to the base, the base can still rotate.  So anytime you stub your toe against a base or one of the base wheels encounters an obstacle while moving the divider, the bases will quickly no longer be perpendicular to the horizontal base pipe.  And, if nothing else, that looks ugly/cheap.  While not as obvious, the connection point between the horizontal top pole ends and the vertical poles would similarly look better (and assemble more easily if the horizontal pole end points were curved to fit the vertical pole.<br /><br />If you don’t put a premium on aesthetics and don’t mind puzzling over installation, for you, this product is probably worth 5 stars.  But to me, those two things deserve two stars off - because for me there’s just no excuse for missing assembly instructions and for cheap-skate assembly.",1674343015799,0,false

3,Too much trouble to assemble for price,"To me, this shoe rack was more trouble than it’s worth.

3,Lightweight; a bit too small to fit bags,"I’ve used and gifted several different types of bag organizers. This is not one of the better ones.<br />It’s a very lightweight wood which isn’t necessarily bad, but being that the larger box (gallon size) has a bottom that slides in and out, I’m afraid if that panel is removed too often, it may crack. While the gallon-sized bags fit okay, the smaller bags (intended to go in the other box) are a very tight fit. i was able to squeeze sandwich and quart bags in there, but the box should be just a little bit bigger.<br />What I do like about these boxes is that the tops are completely open. Others I’ve tried have slots to dispense the bags. I prefer the wide open tops, especially in this case, since I think I’ll use the boxes for something other than bags, seeing as the bags don’t fit that well. Even though these are permanently marked with bag sizes, if that doesn’t bother you, the boxes could be used to store other small items you normally toss in a drawer.<br />The color is dark brown; darker than it appears in the picture.",1673728542093,0,false
2,poorly executed design,"An idea that flatters to deceive.  Not spacious at all - maybe useful for a small child's clothes for a week, but for regular adult (let alone a household), this will be useless unless you may have more frequent laundry cycles than weekly.  Secondly, not all pieces seem to be included or one has to improvise with the stitching to put the poles into place.  Thankfully, it is not available to purchase at the time of review.  Even at seemingly ""cheap"" price, this is not consideration-worthy.  Would have worked for a pool side etc if this could be properly assembled.",1678895348683,0,false

Over a week's use and it seems to provide some support.  Maybe this needs to age like wine.  Not impressed in the initial two weeks of use.

3,crushed incense - but remarkable customer service,"if you are lucky, you may find one or two sticks intact and usable as intended.  Else, expect crushed incense you may need to be creative to use (I used a camphor pot and got some value out of the crushed ones).  The variety is decent, the price/value is ok.  most of the fragrances are nice and unique (cinnamon, tea garden were the least favorites).  Fragrances are going to be a hit-or-miss, but the biggest disappointment is the lack of integrity of these sticks.  If you choose to experiment with this, be aware that you may mostly get crushed sticks - going to stick with a local Indian store that has tons of varieties for incense sticks...<br /><br />update 2/7/23 -  based on my above review, the manufacturer reached out, offered replacements/refunds and potential causes (I didn't take up on any of the offers).  It is great to see the commitment to customer satisfaction and outreach efforts.  Ordering this along with heavier items may be a risk if you expect them to be all in the same package.  However, considering the customer service and potential of replacement I will order one more time - because the scents are actually good and unique.  (upgraded to 3.5*)",1675636854815,0,false
3,"Strong and effective, unclear ingridients","Though it says it is made with 100% essential oils, it is not clear how much of the actual product is made of the essential oils.  It lists fragrances and cosmetic grade chemicals as additional ingredients.  The fragrance is itself is strong, lingers pleasantly.  The plastic bottle is flimsy (can be squeezed easily), the dropper and sprayer attachments are a good bonus. But without knowing what chemicals are included (or not), hard to enthusiastically endorse, especially at this price point.",1674480167368,0,false
1,These are NOT low temperature.,"I'm not new to candle play. I always test on myself first to determine safety, using my wrist to determine the heat intensity. From a respectable height, I dripped two separate drops, as well as one double drip. I could tell immediately that these are just typical paraffin wax candles, both from the smell and from the heat. The wax is crumbly when cool, another indication that they are just regular paraffin wax. Paraffin burns at a high temperature that is not suitable for candle play.<br /><br />Immediately after removing the wax from my wrist, I took the first photograph, with white tiles in the background. You can clearly see red marks left by the two single drops near one another, and another, deeper red one higher up where I did the double drip.<br /><br />The box mentions that these are designed to leave red marks that will fade within 12 to 24 hours, but there is no mention of this in the listing.<br /><br />Candle play should NOT actually do damage to your skin. There is still pain an hour later; in fact, the redness has only increased, which means that I have physically burned my skin. The second photo shows the increased redness. There is also physical damage visible at this point. I fully expect a blister to form by tomorrow.<br /><br />I'm not sure whether these are someone's idea of a sick joke or if they are just poorly designed and untested, but I'm glad I tested them on my arm before using them for their intended purpose. If these were marketed as just regular candles I'd say they were just fine. But because of the way they are marketed, I would not recommend them to anyone! They are not safe for candle play!",1678859079826,1,false
1,"Damaged my floor finish, didn't hold my rug.","As you can see by my photograph, the round sticky dots pulled the finish right off my floor. What they did not do, however, is hold my rug in place. They stick to the floor too well, but they do not hold onto the rug well. If they hadn't damaged my floor finish, I might have given them 3 stars, because they did kind of help keep my rug from getting kicked around quite as easily. The problem is that they just don't stick very well to the rug, so when the rug eventually moves off of them, you end up with these ugly, thick pads stuck to the floor. And when I tried to remove them, they pulled up the finish along with them. Now I have to get my floor refinished. Also, they are bulky and thick, and you can both see and feel them under the rug. They do not simply lie flat. I would not recommend these, especially to anyone with a wood floor.",1678582867958,0,false

1,Didn't maintain adhesion,"I ordered these hooks to hang towels closer to the shower than the towel racks I currently have in the bathroom. The hooks are easy to install. The problem is that they don't stay installed. Before I could even install the second hook, and remember that this is easy and quick to install, the first hook fell off the wall. Seriously. And as I bent to retrieve the first hook, the sound of the second hook falling had me sighing. The actual hook mechanism is sturdy enough to hang towels, but I could not get the suction of the back to keep it on the wall even though I didn't have a towel on it yet. Save your money. Definitely cannot recommend this product.",1673555284092,0,false
3,Zippers are never comfortable to sleep on,"I ordered this mattress protector for our new bed. The protector comes with two zipping top sheets to make it easy to clean up after spills. The issue we are having is that this top slides over every night because my wife is a restless sleeper. The top sheet on this ends up sliding over to her side a bit, leaving me to sleep on the zipper, which is thick and clunky. The idea of the top sheets is great. The execution of the idea, not so much. Otherwise, the protector does as it should, protecting from spills. I wouldn't recommend this if sleeping with a restless partner.",1672700436152,0,false
2,Disappointed,"This is my fourth set of floating shelves in a search for just the right pair for a guest room. Unfortunately, this set did not suffice, though the size was good. These shelves are made of a super lightweight wood - like a balsa, and probably scrap balsa considering the multiple finger joints in the wood. The sides (front and back) are affixed with small brads and glue. The finish is rough and uneven, and the edges are not sanded smooth. Once mounted, you probably wouldn't notice these ""flaws"" but in toto - these are certainly not quality products. I would not be comfortable placing heavy items on them. These shelves are adequate at best. Sadly, I don't believe they are worth the current asking price of nearly $36 for the pair.",1677176781726,0,false

This could potentially prove to be a weak spot.<br />BOTTOM LINE:<br />If you do a lot of baking, you will probably appreciate the versatility this set of spatulas offers at a fairly reasonable price. I do recommend you pay attention to size as these are actually a bit larger than I was expecting.",1673912355772,0,false

3,No Exfoliating Power,"These are super soft washcloths, VERY gentle on the skin. But they were too soft for me. I like something with some scrubbing/exfoliating power like terry. These are highly absorbent cloths, absorbing so much water that they are ""squishy"" and difficult to squeeze dry. They tend to suck up water better than dispense it, so when you wash your face with them they absorb all the liquid, including suds and it's difficult to feel like you are getting a good cleaning. On the other hand, these are so gentle, they would be great for soothing a sunburn or other injury, for steaming or warming your face, or for treating a headache. If you wanted it for those purposes, I'd give it 5 stars, but for washing - it only earns 3.",1673561706963,0,false
3,Probably Overkill for the Average Kitchen,"PROS:<br />Sturdy, sharp and quality pair of kitchen shears.<br />Includes herb shears.<br />Lifetime replacement warranty.<br />CONS:<br />The kitchen shears are tight, meaning they require some effort to open and close. And they don't accommodate my fingers well.<br />There are a lot of features, but apart from easily overlooked photos on the box there are no instructions for use. I wouldn't otherwise know they could crack nuts, scale fish, or peel shrimp. The only ""extra"" I recognized was the bottle opener. And let's face it, most kitchens are equipped with better tools for those tasks. If they aren't, they probably don't need those added features.<br />While the herb shears are great in theory, leafy herbs get caught between the blades, necessitating the need for the included comb to clean them out. I'd just as soon use standard shears and save myself the trouble.<br />BOTTOM LINE:<br />There is nothing really ""wrong"" with these scissors. They are just a bit uncomfortable and overkill for my needs. I'll continue grabbing my standard shears and Ulu knife. For the tasks they perform, they are both superior to this product.",1673479680600,0,false

The metal rods are dangerous and rigid, I was afraid to get the plastic wheels  back in place because I did not want to cut my palms, knowing how sharp the edges are.

3,"Sharp enough to cut a hand, but not a carrot","This is a very useful tool overall, but I'm not sure that I can recommend it after the experience I had.<br /><br />I was excited to use this to help with some NYE food prep. It did the trick with soft foods, but I tried to use the small square blade to cut carrots. I pre-sliced them to make it easier for them to go through, but the plastic piece that pushes food through wasn't strong enough for a carrot. Then, the carrots were stuck in the blade and I couldn't get them out at all, rendering the blade absolutely useless-- and I cut my finger really bad in the process of trying to get the carrots out.<br /><br />I hurt another finger just moving one of the pieces around.<br /><br />Even if that hadn't happened, I found the blades challenging to remove/switch out. There is a SINGLE protection glove included, but it'd be better to include a full part considering the number of sharp parts this thing has.",1672632116564,0,false

The smaller holes do make it a better strainer than the slotted spoons I already had, so high marks in that area.<br /><br />It does come in handy if you're short on space. It allowed me to remove a few tools from my utensil crock and clear out some of that clutter.<br /><br />I do wonder about the heat-resistance claims.

3,Cute but not especially good in the air fryer,"These come folded in thirds, and keep that shape when taken out of the package (although in the air fryer it did stay fairly round, even in a square air fryer basket). Mine still want to fold up if they are not on a very stable surface and are empty, even after use and being unfolded for weeks. They are definitely toward the thin/floppy end of silicone liners, and the raised face design on the bottom doesn’t seem to work very well for allowing airflow. The pumpkin design is very cute. I wish I enjoyed using them more, because did I mention cute?<br /><br />I think the design is probably better suited to baking, serving a holiday snack, or as a mold for jello or ice or the like. In the air fryer the top edge curving in doesn’t seem to be helpful. It still kind of works, though, so if cuteness is the main goal, you can get away with it. You might be happier using something else for a liner and then putting your snacks into the jack-o-lantern face to serve, though.",1675216684400,0,false
3,"Good quality, not particularly useful design","Slightly flexible, but pretty stiff. The large base means that you need a 2 ¼” square that is either flat or very gently curved in order to make the cord wrap stick down. The arms of the wrap are also short, so they won’t work well for cords that are thick or long. I tried one on an air purifier, and it works- but the cord is too long to not fall off the wrap unless very carefully placed.<br /><br />They work, but the design makes them very limited in where they will be useful. Unless you have a lot of appliances that are both large (and flat/square) and have very short cords, you will probably have a hard time using them. Most of the small countertop appliances I want to use these on (which have the short cords needed) do not have an appropriately large space to attach them (especially a space that does not get particularly hot in use)<br /><br />The adhesive is good, so they should stay on well, if you find a place they will fit.",1672820124158,0,false

3,Inaccurate product description and labeling,"[[VIDEOID:b80949a6455390fcaf6f50960c24849d]] Made in China, this pack of mylar style food storage bags is described in the first product description as being 9.44 ml thick, then further down the page they are advertised as up to 10 ml thick with 5 ml per side, and finally the package itself says they're 8 ml thick.<br /><br />None of the above is accurate! These bags are 5 ml thick (total) at most. That means each side of the bag is 5 ml thick which gives you a 5 ml bag, not 8, not 9.44, and not 10 either. See the video I provided to see exactly what I mean.<br /><br />These bags are somewhat thinner and a lot more flimsy than Wallaby's 5 ml bags, and they aren't anywhere near comparable to a Harvest Right 7 ml bag.<br /><br />On the positive side they do have a ziploc closure top and a gusseted bottom. That makes it easy to hold more in each bag than a non-gusseted bag could, and you can reseal the bags after opening as long as you sealed them correctly.<br /><br />I would use these bags for foods that you plan to use for camping, hiking, or 1 to 2 years storage time, but not for long term storage.  I'd also suggest using them for softer foods rather than anything with sharp edges since they are very thin.<br /><br />The package includes 120 oxygen absorbers that are all packed in one bag rather than packed in packs of 10.  If you use these you will need to repackage them into smaller units you can seal until needed or risk exposing them all to oxygen each time you need a few.<br /><br />There's nothing that indicates how many cc's they're supposed to be, but they look way too small to be 400 cc's which is the size needed for gallon bags. I compared them against two US made 300 cc absorbers and they're significantly smaller than either of those so I doubt that they hold enough iron to be 300 cc's let alone 400 cc's.  I wouldn't risk having food go bad by using them, so I advise tossing them in file 13 and going with a brand you can trust instead. Food is too expensive to risk losing by using under strength oxygen absorbers.<br /><br />Anyone buying these bags based on the advertised thickness is going to be extremely upset when they get them.  The seller needs to correct the misleading description and packaging ASAP.  5 ml bags have some uses however, so I'll be generous enough to give the product 3 stars rather than 2.",1677981053364,5,false

3,"Makes machine quality water, fairly involved cleanup required each time","I started with one brand new unit and a full run and got crystal clean water that tasted like chlorinated dirt.<br /><br />Looked in the unit and it's caked completely with Nashville's finest water additives. Scrubbed that out and tried again and same result. A five minute cleaning for slightly less than a gallon of water.<br /><br />Let a gallon of water sit a day to maybe get the chlorine out like you do for watering plants. Now just tastes like it's run through old pipes.<br /><br />At 15-20 minutes of my life invested in cleaning out the sediment from these last runs I decided to switch to using filtered water before distilling it. This left the interior caked in white powder as opposed to reddish ick but the flavor improved. Unfortunately it wasn't better than the filtered water straight from the fridge.<br /><br />OK, giving up using this to make the water taste good as nothing I do makes the Nashville water taste better. I mean it's probably cleaner judging by what I have to clean, but the result is flat and meh.<br /><br />In order for this to pay for itself it's going to have to offset $80 or so. Each run takes about 3kW of electricity, or $0.39 per gallon. It's also putting off 750 watts of heat for three hours, so if it's run indoors in warmer weather you're going to have to cool what it's heating, figure ten cents there give or take depending on too many factors.<br /><br />So each gallon costs about $0.49 to produce meaning I'm saving about $0.50 per gallon if that. At 160 gallons this will break even. At my use rate this puts it at sometime three years in the future when I've spent 26.6 hours cleaning sediment out of the unit I will see my first penny saved.<br /><br />Now, obviously your use cases will be different than mine, but I was hoping for good tasting water, didn't expect this was a room heater that there's not a good way to safely use it outside, and did not expect the cleanup that was going to be required every run. It will eventually pay for itself but was not what I was expecting from the rave reviews of good tasting water.<br /><br />Then again, every place's water is different... it didn't work here for taste but might there.",1678288714204,4,true

I am disappointed in this new set because they are quite flimsy compared to the old set which held their shape really well. :(  BTW, the colors I got were not the colors pictured, which ticks me off some more. The colors I received are ok, but I wanted the colors on the pic.  This kind of ""false  advertising"" angers me and seems to happen quite a bit among Chinese companies.  If an American company did this it could be sued.  On the other hand, there has been much improvement on similar issues with other Chinese companies even to the point of better consumer service and standing behind their products.  Still ticked off, though.",1677602943725,0,true

The spoonful of sugar produces a small amount of cotton candy, so it takes a few rounds to produce enough to fill a small bag of cotton candy. Sugar tends to stick inside the pot. You have to stop the machine tap the edge of the pot to loosen the sugar and restart the machine. If you don’t do it fast enough, the sugar will burn and make bad tasting cotton candy once you loosen it. Cleaning the plastic is easy. The problem is that sugar gets into the burner area and it’s very hard to get out. If you can get this for ~$20 it’s worth it. If you pay more than that you’re wasting your money.

1,Doesn't Sweep Up Well,I have bought a lot of Anker products because I think they have quality products so I purchased the handheld vacuum with high expectations.<br /><br />I was disappointed in the handheld vacuum for several reasons -<br />- It charges with an USB charger rather than a wall charger.<br />- It does not pick up debris well and at times it seems as though it blows it around the room.<br />- The battery life is short (under 15 minutes) so you have to wait hours for it to recharge to continue to use it.<br />- It is lightweight but the weight is heavy at the end of it so it is not comfortable to use it.<br /><br />I would not recommend it.

The organizer shelves were made out of plastic. The plastic was not flimsy but it was not heavy duty either. I only put lightweight items on it such as Kleenex boxes, air fresheners, etc... I am not sure how well it would hold cleaning products without the shelves cracking or warping from the weight of it. I like that it has hooks on it so you can hang items from it.<br /><br />My bathroom sink cabinet is more organized but I would probably look for a sturdier one to store heavier items unless you store them on the bottom shelf.",1672705379938,0,true

There were two times I forgot to put on inner lid, oh man, coffee powders spilled everywhere, what a mess and cleanup! The design should be that inner lid is required to start grinding.<br /><br />- the bottom of stainless steel cup has plastic area that would attract and hide powders. I don’t want to wash the cup every time I use it<br />- when I put the cup into place, it does not have the click sound or latch feel, kind of like putting a screw in, is it tight enough or sjould I turn more?<br /><br />- now, serious issue - the blades do not appear to be sharp. I got uneven powder sizes<br /><br />- the motor also seems weak and loud.

3,Great vacuum for the price.,"Even though I think this is a wonderful vacuum I didn’t end up keeping it. I tried it for about a month and decided that I would return it and try something else.<br />CONS<br />-I didn’t like that when you press the button you have to go through all the speeds to turn it off. Or if you were on high speed you have to turn it off to then go back to low speed.<br />-It’s not easy to detach the pieces of the vacuum. You have to hold down the button and wiggle them for them to come apart.<br />-I didn’t like the brush attachment. I found it very hard to suck up debris. There are two holes within the middle of the bristles and nothing seemed to go in either hole. Also, the bristles are not sturdy and it made it very difficult to try and clean baseboards.<br />-I did not like how the attachments stored. The crevice tool stuck straight out and fit very loosely on the holder. Any little bump and that thing was falling to the ground.<br />-Hair or dust would get stuck in the upper part of the filter. I couldn’t figure out how or if I could remove the filter to even clean it out.<br /><br />PROS<br />-the suction is great. There are only two settings, but I never had issues when using it as a vacuum and picking up hair or other debris.<br />-I like that there was a carpet brush and floor brush. I tried to vacuum a larger room and although it was doing great, I think it would just take a while. But it picked up all the dog hair. The brushes are also easy to remove and it’s easy to clean hair from them.<br />-There is no battery to charge or extra battery to buy. You just plug in the vacuum. It charged rather quickly. I would say within a hour.<br />-the charge lasted a while. I was able to vacuum kitchen, dining room, stairs, bedroom and two bathrooms on full charge. We do have about a 1300 sq foot home, but only some rooms are hardwood.<br /><br />I would definitely recommend this vacuum. It wasn’t great for me, but might work great for someone else.",1673315169131,3,true

2,Disappointing,"Braun had always had a good reputation but this coffee maker is a disappointment. I bought it in October 2021 and within 6 months, a small spot starting forming on the heating element. I don't think there was anything I had done to cause it because I was always careful to clean it gently with a slightly damp sponge or paper towel, never with chemical clearners, and never scrubbed it.  The spot wouldn't rub off and grew bigger over time. Then, the outer black layer just peeling off  to the point in my photos, taken about 14 months after purchase and 1st use. Now,  half of the heating element is corroded. The melted black material has burned itself onto the bottom of the carafe, and scrubbing with a non-scratch sponge and dishwashing soap or soaking doesn't remove it.  At this point, I don't know if this is a fire hazard. I decided to share this review with you to save you the grief of buying it. Also, if it catches on fire, I'll have documentation of the event.

I am an experienced cook, so I now my way around the kitchen and good breakfast food.  They also advertise a ""Feel Good Guarantee"" and a great customer service team...so I called immediately after the cooking cycle ended, and ended up with a very ""flippant"", unfriendly rep who said I just need to figure out how much extra time to leave the lid on to reach my desired doneness.  Yea, I could have guessed that.  But not really what you advertised Dash!  No better than figuring out/adjusting  my cooking time on the stove each morning.

3,Holes too big for unsoaked salad mixes despite advertising. Center design does help drainage.,"I was heartbroken to lose many of my seeds on the first rinse before they had a chance to soak and swell. Many seeds got firmly stuck in the mesh as well and could only be removed with a needle or fine point tweezer—a great deal of work. It wouldn’t be the end of the world if soak-swollen seeds that are starting to germinate got stuck during an aeration session. But if they’re stuck before they had a chance to soak and cannot be rinsed off back into the jar, then there’s no hope for the seeds to grow. It looked like two of the four seeds included in my mix were hopelessly too small. And cleaning the seeds out of the lid took absolute ages.<br /><br />Thankfully the bag of seeds I’m using gives directions that involve soaking *before* the first rinse, in contrast to most directions you can find online. Since I had trouble finding durable replacement lids with smaller holes at the right price and since I wasn’t yet sure if sprouting was worth a larger investment, I decided to try this method. It seems like you need a good six rinses or so after the soak with this method, but the seeds had swollen to the point where this lid was usable.<br /><br />One concern for me about the metal mesh lids is that to get them to drain ideally, you really should press on the mesh with one finger while shaking and swirling. And it really is important for good and safe growth to shake hard and use centrifugal force, not just prop the jars upside down. I have tiny hands, so that small extra complication could create issues. In contrast, the smart design of this lid allows for quite a bi5 of water to spin out of the center when doing the jiggles and slaps and shakes. I may be coming around on these lids despite my initial disappointment.<br /><br />Note that the methods where you do not rinse seed before soaking should never be used on seed that’s not explicitly sold for soaking, as regular seeds and beans are more likely to have pathogens that could grow in an initial soak. For instance, i won’t use this with my ordinary quinoa seed. But for my salad mix, this is okay.",1678590884247,0,true

Burn hazard not to mention injury hazard if one isn’t aware and touches it.<br /><br />Also it doesn’t have a timer like the egg cooker. So my first round of egg bites ended up too well done with the top being a bit too brown. So I have to figure out what the time is to be appropriate to get nice fluffy bites.<br /><br />Advice: do not fill up the cups to the top. Like muffins, with the device closed, the egg rises up and lifts the top letting the steam out.

3,"Cool device, but overhyped. See notes...","[[VIDEOID:e5c918b28ea0f30cb3103ea9e2366439]] I kept hearing about this device, and it looks really cool, too... so I was delighted when my mom gifted this to me over the holidays.<br /><br />Some pros:<br />1. The ""ready"" sound is beautiful! I've heard from others before that their older models had a really alarming, scary sound... so I'm glad this improvement has been made. (Though I also wish you could change the setting so that you can adjust WHEN the sound happens, depending on how you want to cook the eggs... similar to an Instant Pot. Right now the sound default happens when the eggs have been cooked / water has evaporated).<br />2. It works. That's the biggest thing, right?<br />3. I didn't realize you could also make an omelette or poach eggs in this, with the included accessories.<br />4. The packaging and design is quite cute and clever. From a marketing standpoint, their customer engagement on social media is also pretty impressive!<br /><br />Some cons, though:<br />1. The packaging never tells you this from the outside, but in order to hard-boil the eggs, you need to actually poke a hole at the top of each egg. I honestly feel like it takes more effort and stress to make sure I don't crack the eggs while doing this... versus just boiling eggs the old-fashioned way. But maybe it's just because I'm not used to it, yet?<br />2. The size is limiting. I mean I like that it's small in the sense that it doesn't take up too much counter space. But if I want to make more eggs, I can't... I'm limited to the space they have in the device. So it'd be more worth my time (in my opinion) to just use a pot or pan.<br /><br />So... even though the number of pros outweigh the cons, for me personally, I'm just not sold on this product yet. Maybe it's because I haven't used it very much and am still used to cooking eggs the old-fashioned way... or maybe it's because I prefer to cook more in bulk than in small portions. Either way, it's honestly quite puzzling to me why so many people love this product so much...",1672613926011,1,false

3,"Noisy, but the bracket is nice","I like the bracket for this fan as it solves the problem of how to attach a fan like this. The fan attaches to the bracket by a long bolt that goes through one of the four corner holes. The brackets also respond to magnets well, so you can attach this with magnets if you are mounting this on a metal surface. This fan is thicker than most fans, so the bracket will work with most fans that have a corner hole to thread the bolt through. The speed dial is nice, but it is a bit bulky and you need to figure out how to best attach it yourself. You can screw it on, but it should attach well with sticky pads. The product only comes with two wood screws, so you either screw in the controller or the bracket. If you screw into drywall then you should supply your own drywall anchors.<br /><br />At the slowest speeds, it has an annoying grinding motor noise, so I would not place this in a space where the noise will be bothersome. It is louder than it should be at the slower speeds. At the highest speeds, the fan is loud.<br /><br />My intended use for a fan like this is for my enclosed air handler closet to prevent mold buildup. The speed controller aspect of this adds a layer of inefficiency to the energy use. If you want a constant speed then using a fixed-speed fan will be more efficient and get rid of the bulky controller. The current price is $30.",1678046132581,0,false

1,Poorly designed shower door caddy. Attaches with adhesive.,"This caddy comes in multiple pieces and the pieces are held together by gravity.

I was not looking for a caddy that is permanently attached, as I want to remove the caddy when cleaning the caddy or when cleaning the shower.<br /><br />This cannot attach to a shower head. It is designed to go over a wall, but the top is too wide for most glass doors. The top bracket is wider than what the marketing photo suggests. I can fit 10 glass panes in the top bracket.<br /><br />You have to assemble this and the assembly is not obvious. The instructions are printed on the box. If someone later has to reassemble this without having the box they will struggle.<br /><br />The shelf heights are adequate.

I had bean bag chairs 25 years ago in a game room and they were very pliable and comfortable, so I assumed these would be as well, but no.

3,So much white powder,"First, the plants were a bear to get out of the foam holder. I guess this could be considered good, but after wrangling with it for about 10 minutes I was finally able to get the planters free.<br />Second, there was SO much white powder all over the plant that it was difficult to see the true colors. I took them outside and used compressed air on the plants. White powder was flying all over the place.<br />Third, I still had to hand wipe most of the petals/leaves to get the remaining white powder off. I suspect it was to keep the leaves from getting waxy or sticking together, but it was annoying.<br />Last, imho they do NOT look anywhere close to real (I thought for this price they would be a lot closer to real looking than they are). They definitely look like fake, plastic plants; unless they are on a high shelf or where they can't be inspected up close.<br />  Not very impressed and unfortunately, they will not be going where I had intended.",1677891188553,0,false

Thick conditioners are hard to get primed.<br /><br />That said, I would look for a better quality product than these.<br /><br />After about a month of use, one started continuously leaking shampoo out the spout making a mess and a slipping hazard.

3,Made in China. Probably not the best option for most. Cannot drink from the lid.,"The first thing you should know about this tumbler is the fact that it does not have a lid to drink from. So the only way to drink from this tumbler is to remove the lid completely. This will probably not be the best option for many.<br /><br />This tumbler measures 6 ½ inches tall. It measures two and three-quarter inches across on the bottom. It does not have a rubber or silicone ring on the bottom, so it is quite slick. It has a powder coating, so it is hand wash only. The easiest way to clean it is with a bottle brush, which is sold separately. There is a silicone carrying strap attached to the lid.<br /><br />This tumbler is made in China and shows to be sold by a company in the US. At the current price of just over seventeen bucks it is crazy overpriced for such a small tumbler without a lid that you can drink from. A more appropriate price would be around five bucks.",1677357727249,0,false
3,Made in China.  Thin and lightweight.  Overpriced.,"These are very thin and lightweight totes.  If you’re looking for grocery bags. . .  .There are much better options.

There’s a gusset on the bottom, but it does not stand flat and stay flat because there’s no cardboard or plastic on the bottom.<br /><br />These totes are Made in China and being sold by a Chinese company on Amazon.  At the current price of 13 bucks. . .  They are well over twice the price they should be.  Again, for lightweight totes, they are fine. . . but not for grocery shopping.  I can find better quality shopping bags at my local store for less money.",1676823356618,0,false
3,"Made in China. Crazy overpriced. Okay for hot chocolate, but not much else.","I wanted to get this item a try with hot chocolate. So often with hot chocolate it settles to the bottom before you can finish it. This cup certainly alleviates that issue. But to be honest, for anything other than hot chocolate, I really don’t see the need. On top of this, if you watch the video, you place a “tablet” in the bottom of the cup to start. That “tablet” is what rotates and stirs the beverage. I just keep thinking that I’m going to swallow it. Or perhaps lose it when cleaning. I recommend you watch some of the listing videos so you have a better idea of exactly what this is and how it works.<br /><br />The warming tray keeps the beverage fairly warm but not really hot. So if you are looking for something that’s going to keep your beverage really hot, then this might not be it.<br /><br />This item is made in China and being sold by Chinese company on Amazon. The current price shows to be seventy bucks, but there is a thirty dollar coupon currently, if you click the box. Even at thirty bucks off it is still super crazy over-the-top overpriced.

1,Display unreadable. Easy to change countdown accidently.,"I do 3, 5, and 15 minute countdowns a lot, so this looked like a good idea. Only, even with fully charged batteries (2 AAA), the display is barely visible when you set the time then goes dark as it counts down. I need to see the countdown. If I pick up the alarm to try to read the time (back when I thought I could), the slightest tilt resets the alarm to the adjacent countdown time. When doing the 30 minute countdown, the alarm never went off. Apparently, it'd just turned itself off. The volume is certainly loud enough on the alarm, and you can adjust the volume up and down. and even mute it. There are strong magnets on the back so you can attach it to metal, but these also try to grab your batteries as you put them in. I've also not been able to successfully set a custom time, partly because I can't see the display time when you're supposed to set it and partly because tilting the alarm (after the custom time is set) resets the time to the top preset time. It's useless to me.",1677185561277,1,false
3,Starter free but have to order it separately. Disappointed with the starter.,"The kit included everything except the sourdough starter (which makes sense since it'll be live rather than dried). I looked at the kit and at the contents of one jar and didn't notice that in the OTHER jar there was a small note explaining how to receive your live starter. Several days later, as no starter had showed up, I did a more thorough search and found this information. The starter is free with the included link and code, but you have to follow the link to the Full Proof Baking shop and follow the simple directions to get the starter shipped.<br /><br />The kit itself looks good and included directions. There's also a video on their site showing how to optimally use the kit. I'm looking forward to trying it and will update after doing so.<br /><br />UPDATE: So I ordered the sourdough starter on a Thursday, it was shipped on Friday and it arrived on Wednesday. There's about 11g of starter, but the instructions say to only use 5g. I wish I'd used the full amount as I might have had better results. After 12 hours, I saw only a few bubbles but no other activity. I just used that as the starter amount and did the 1:1:1 ratio for 72F. 12 hours later, it had more bubbles but still wasn't rising. I followed the directions until day 3, but the starter still was having trouble doubling in 12 hours so I stuck with the lower feeding level of day 2. Day 3 actually doubled, so I followed the directions from then on. On day 6, I took my cast-off starter (over a cup) and used it along with some current starter to make a loaf. I did the initial rise overnight (around 14 hours). I'm an experienced bread maker, and I used every trick I knew, but the loaf hadn't doubled in the pan even in 6 hours and I needed to bake it. The bread hardly tasted sour (though there was a slight tang) and the bread crumbled to pieces as I cut it, which is not usual for that recipe. I guess I need to watch her sourdough bread recipes and try again, but I'd thought it'd be much less work and usable in normal recipes, and it'd not. This failure may be user error on my part, but her video implies that the starter should have been much stronger from Day 1.",1676586571980,0,false
2,Have to use an App to control it. Not battery-powered.,"I'm not sure why I thought it was battery powered with an option for plug-in power, but it only runs off the outlet. I certainly thought the mention of an App was an optional thing, but you set up the alarm and the Bluetooth speaker through an app on your Smart Phone. Problem: I don't own a Smart Phone and intended to connect the BlueTooth to my desktop computer, anyway. So this won't work for me. Two stars simply because it doesn't appear to be broken.<br /><br />Update: YIZEELFAR store contacted me to provide this information: ""May I know if you have connect the device to your desktop computer? If yes, the device can be used as a Clock, Bluetooth speaker , sound machine and night light, but can not use the Alarm function. You can control the device through the button to choose the light color, as a Bluetooth speaker to play music, play sleep sounds. If you have any question to use the device, please contact us any time. We are always here for you."" So they have good customer service.

3,Firm stuffing,"The shell pattern is only on one side, so you can have the smooth side against your back if the slight ridges from the decorative shell pattern bother you. The filling is very firm, and I'd been hoping for something with a little more give. The outer fabric is a velvet fabric. I measured mine at 14"" long by 9.5"" tall by about 4"" thick at the thickest spot.<br /><br />UPDATE: I haven't used this much, but I'm already seeing that the stitching along the final stuffing seam is the weak point. Basically, little bits of stuffing are sticking out and might come out as the seam isn't as small/tight as expected. I think it's so overstuffed that it strains the seam when you put weight against it.",1673022140759,0,false

This item would have been better made out of a softer material that could be molded to YOUR neck and where the pain may be plus it should be longer.  I'm a lady and this barely fit my neck!

The outer cover is “cool” to the touch, but it’s not especially noticeable with a pillowcase on top. What I really don’t like about these is that the outer shell isn’t a zipper case to remove the cover and wash it. This is a huge design letdown in my opinion, as the pillows are otherwise spot clean only. I’d probably skip these and opt for something with a washable cover for better hygiene.

1,Well.....,I ordered this for my guest room. We had company coming for the holidays and minnesota is so cold.. ordered it In dark grey. They sent snow white. Did I mention i own a dark cat? Haha After I asked for a exchange it showed they were in the process of sending the correct color blanket out. I wrote them and asked them to please rush it. They then stopped the shipping status and it changed to giving us a refund. But it would take 3-5 business days. I did not have extra cash or time to go find another blanket!  They asked me to print the return label and I tried but my printer would not link and print. So I asked them to please send me a return label. We live in the middle of nowhere.  It's not possible for me to just run to town. We then had a family emergency happen. Family came from out of town early and I had to open the blanket and use it at this point. But when I went to write them I noticed that they had now canceled my refund anyway. Long story short the blanket is very nice. It gets very warm and has easy to use controls for each side of the bed. But the controller on one side quit working after the first night of use for the family in that room. When I turned it on the second night the controller on the bed stand flickered a few times and the light went out.. made a zip noise and stopped heating that side.. my guest said one side was good enough but I felt bad. Now I'm stuck with a horrible white blanket with one working side. I really wish we could have had better customer service and communication.  I am out alot of money and time due to my purchase. I would still like some resolve. I just gave up on this.,1673318416470,1,true

What is worse is trying to purchase a replacement for the brush roller which has been an ongoing issue and because we bought a second one for the upper floor of our house it is doubly so. In seems the part is out of stock for long periods of time and the company can’t even forecast a date for it to be available. They will of course tell you how sorry they are and just to keep checking back for when it is available. This last saga started around Christmas it is now the middle of March.

I have used the pan for several days now and like the way food cooks in it IF YOU KEEP THE HEAT TO LOW OR LOW/MEDIUM. DO NOT COOK HIGHER THAN MEDIUM OR THE HANDLE WILL BECOME TOO HOT TO HANDLE. Other frying pan manufactures have seemed to solve this problem by somehow insulating the handle from the pan itself.

I'm not sending it back ONLY because I saw a restocking fee and I refuse to send it back and lose that much money.<br /><br />I bought this 24"" x 24"" square mirror for my grandchildren's playroom and for them to use it as a dress-up mirror.  I quickly realized that, no matter which way the mirror was oriented, it makes you look oddly fat.  I do not want any of my granddaughters to end up with a bad body self-image so this mirror is getting donated.<br /><br />I reached out to the company and their only statement was that the distortion was mentioned in the listing.  So, I went back and looked and, yes, it is written around the last line, and (apparently) I didn't read that far down ... so, yes, this may be my fault for not reading EVERY line.  I tend to count on reviews more than the actual product information.  I am highly disappointed in all the great reviews of this product.<br /><br />So, If you want the mirror for looking at people, be forewarned, this mirror gives off the fun-house, clownish image - even when completely flat against the wall and irregardless of which way the mirror is hung (with our 24"" x 24"" square mirror, we had 4 chances for one of the sides to show correctly when perfectly flat).  My suggestion is that if you want to actually get a true image of yourself in the mirror, then you should AVOID THIS !!!

2,My least favorite SCA certified coffee maker,"I own a number of SCA brewers (Bonavita 1800, 1900, Braun Multiserve, Kitchenaid Custom Pour Over, and the Oxo 9 cup), and this Oxo 8 cup is my least favorite. It produces the least enjoyable coffee, and that is after experimenting quite a bit with grind size and ratios. Not exactly sure wha'ts going on -- everything else about the machine is solid... Looks great, nice size, easy to clean -- but for whatever reason the coffee it brews is noticeably inferior to what I get on my other machines. The brews always taste thin and slightly underextracted. I've tried fining up the grind, but the best I got was a thin, flat tasting overextracted coffee. And that's the biggest takeaway with all of the brews I've made on it -- they all taste somewhat flat (not a lot of flavor). Maybe it's the flat bottom basket, not sure, but the Bonavita 1900 is also flat bottom and brews a much better pot. It's possible I got a bad brewer here, but nothing about it appears to be faulty.<br /><br />Anyway, I do not recommend this machine. I have quite a bit of experience with SCA coffee brewers, and so far my favorite for everyday use is the Braun Multiserve. It brews much better coffee too!",1677303552958,0,false

2,"Builds up deposits quickly, temp display jumps around","First off, I need to say that Bonavita seems to offer clever products with well-thought-out design BUT that the build of those products have always seemed flawed to the point of being defective. I bought several of their immersion coffee drippers, which made great coffee until the switch controlling the flow of coffee INVARIABLY broke off. You'll see this complaint in multitudes of user reviews on Amazon. But instead of fixing the relatively simple design issue, Bonavita opted to discontinue the dripper. Tells you something about the company, doesn't it?<br /><br />Annoying and deal-breaking build problems are also associated with this gooseneck kettle. There's a lot to like about the kettle. But there were two deal breakers for me.<br /><br />1) Reviewers are correct that some sort of crap builds up on the bottom of the kettle. I'd say it's rust, but seeing as how it started after only the second kettle of water I boiled, that seems unlikely. More likely it's some type of scale from the mineral content of the water...but I use filtered water, and this doesn't happen with, for example, my OXO 8-cup automatic brewer. EVER. I've used Dezcal descaler, and that cleans it up just fine...but it always comes back, and quickly. I complained to Bonavita and they immediately sent me a second kettle, without even asking for the first one back, which is a credit to them...but the second one wasn't any better, so I just said to heck with it and settled for constant descaling.<br /><br />2) The real deal-breaker was having to put up with the temperature control, both because of the way the kettle ALWAYS exceeds the set temperature, and because of fluctuations on the display once the kettle reached the target temperature I set. An example: I almost always set my kettle for 204, for making pourover coffee. The kettle will invariably heat to 208, and once it gets there, the display will fluctuate multiple times per second, reading rapidly flickering numbers that fluctuate between 200 and 208 and never settle down to a single readable temp. I discovered with my Thermapen instant read thermometer that the actual temp in the kettle is always the highest number in this jumpy display...but who wants to live with that? Descaling the kettle hasn't helped; neither has using contact cleaner on the contacts.<br /><br />When I originally bought the kettle, it was one of the few electric variable-temp goosenecks available.  It was in fact the only one I could find. Since then, a number of less expensive alternatives have appeared on the market. Last month, I decided to go in the other direction and get a pricey one, the Stagg EKG Pro Electric Kettle, Studio Edition. I justified the expense by thinking about my years of frustration with the Bonavita and with the recognition that I use the kettle to make coffee every day and that my wife uses it to make tea almost every day. It's a beautiful kettle that functions flawlessly, and if the $225 price-tag doesn't make you run screaming in the other direction, you'll find it a joy to use and to own.",1675530604657,1,true

3,Updated Review,"2/28/2023 UPDATE:  After using these mats for several weeks, I think it's only fair to upgrade my impression of these cutting mats. Top of my list is that while the mats may stain (from items not being washed off within an hour or so), onion odors wash completely off.  Second, the dependability, flexibility of the mats no longer bugs me: They wash conveniently in the narrow hand-washing portion of my sink.  They stay put on the counter if I run my wet hand over the counter before putting down the mat. Conveniently, the mat spins nicely to cross cut my vegetables without having to reposition the veggies themselves.<br /><br />ORIGINAL<br />The negatives are substantial for these cutting mats even though they do what they're designed for: protect the counter and my knives.<br />(1) The mat are so floppy that they won't stand up in my dish drainer after washing them. (2) The mats are extremely slippery on my counter. Both hands should be able to be used for the process of cutting and chopping instead of having to use one hand to hold the mat from slipping off the counter.<br />Would I recommend or buy again?  NO.",1673441616208,1,true

Next I moved on to the Bonavita dripper, which was made of porcelain and had a very simple and effective release lever. The Bonavita had great heat retention, used standard #4 filters, and was easy to use. It was my driver for years but then one day I dropped it on the floor, and it's been discontinued, so...<br /><br />Here we are. My next immersion dripper, Hario. As compared to my previous favorite:<br />- Like the Bonavita, the Hario dripper doesn't put my hot coffee in touch with plastic. YAY!<br />- Unlike the Bonavita, this dripper uses nonstandard filters. These are more expensive, and I'm also not a fan of the thicker paper as compared to the brand I was using with the Bonavita (Filtropa), so I'll give this a BIG NAY. At least I'm not getting too much paper taste. (But more on taste in a moment.)<br />- The Hario glass seems to have less effective heat retention than the Bonavita's porcelain. I can't prove that but I just don't feel that I'm getting a good heat up without a lot more initial water pouring. Not sure what the net impact is but I'll give this a MEH.<br />- The Hario, unlike the Bonavita, is super-easy to completely disassemble and clean. Huge YAY here. My Bonavita was somewhat grungy inside, as was revealed after it shattered. Ew.<br />- The Bonavita had significantly more water capacity. I can't brew more than 24g of coffee in the Hario, whereas I used to be able to go over 30 in the Bonavita. NAY.<br />- No lid. The Bonavita didn't have one either. Clever for the win here! Why can't we get a nice lid and keep the water hot and contained, coffee dripper companies?<br /><br />Actual coffee rating? Well, here's where things go totally south for Hario. I've simply not gotten very good results with the Hario to date. I'm getting really sharp and bitter cups, with the same coffee and procedure that used to render excellent results with the Bonavita. What's different? First of all, the geometry of the dripper, which I theorize concentrates too much of the drainage through the narrow tip of the coffee at the end, thereby causing overextraction at that point. Second, the thick Hario paper and (perhaps) not well engineered interior, which cause a very long drainage time, thereby exacerbating the overextraction problem. No paper taste at least.<br /><br />So where does this leave me? Not immersion brewing all that much; I'm sticking with pour-over from my Kalita Wave for now and just using the Hario on occasion when I'm bored. I'm hoping that James Hoffmann, who says that he is a fan of the Hario, will create a guide to using it that will help me get a better result. While I wait for that, I'm not going to bother drinking too many cups of really bad coffee.<br /><br />So in summary: I weep for the loss of my precious Bonavita, I can not really recommend this thing at the moment, and also looking back on this review it's apparent that I probably need to drink less coffee. Should I crack the code on getting better results from the Hario I'll come back and update the review. Until then, happy brewing!",1675099119857,9,true
3,"Not Great: Inelegant, Rough Seams","These are, I guess, okay glasses. They're at a price point right about where you start kind of wanting something nicer, and they just don't quite deliver.<br /><br />The overall form factor is decent but not quite as elegant as some more upscale brands. The bowl has a slightly boxy feel and the stem could perhaps be just a touch longer. It's good enough but just doesn't feel especially graceful.<br /><br />Drinking from these glasses is relatively enjoyable. The glasses have sort of a middle of the road heft and the lip has no roll. Experience about on par with most decent brands. The bowl is a bit on the wider side which some might argue won't concentrate aromas as well, but I kind of prefer it.<br /><br />The big downside here is that the glasses have odd and uneven seams. The stem has very noticeable seam lines in some places but not others. Where the stem meets the foot, there is a seam on one side and it's smooth on the other side -- as though the glass wasn't welded together evenly. (I guess that's exactly the problem, actually.) And all around the edge of the foot is a sharp-feeling (but not actually sharp) seam. The seams aren't especially noticeable with the eye, but when I'm drinking I definitely feel them with my hand and it detracts -- heavily -- from the experience.<br /><br />If these glasses were nice and smooth I'd give them 4 stars for sure. But as-is I'm kind of torn between the 3 I'm granting here and even downgrading to 2. I just don't think that glasses in this price range should feel this rough and unfinished.<br /><br />All in all, not really recommended. I'll keep them around for parties or whatever, or maybe I'll try to sand them down a bit if I'm bored one day. They definitely won't be my choice when breaking out special bottles.",1673106818576,1,true

3,Depends what you use it for,"This beefier version and all the cheap ones I have seen use the same ring of induction heat.  Slipped down to 3-stars because I had hoped for the price, something better when it comes to heat adjustment (although I never did try the other mode). It seems like it won’t boil anything unless I adjust the temperature up to 280F..  And when trying to simmer, the heat adjustments are 20F increments.<br /><br />I think this induction burner is made for a large pot the size of a frying pan, because of the ring of induction heat (that all the burners seem to share).  Because induction heat the pan itself, the ring of induction heat creates a hot spot in the pan in the shape of a ring (not just this one, all induction burners I have used).  And a thick bottom pan will make no difference..<br /><br />The size and narrowness of the induction heat ring also makes it problematic to use both sauce pans & frying pans (all induction burners I have seen)..  for example, when trying to cook, oatmeal or rice in a sauce, pan, the ring of heat will cause the edges to boil, which forces the rice/oatmeal to the center, basically, forcing you to do extra work stirring it.  And when, using a frying pan (larger than the induction ring), and omelette will stick above the ring, while the center lags behind getting cooked (making it very difficult to flip)..  Another reason this is problematic with eggs, is if you overcook them the flavor disappears (forced to compensate. I end up cooking scrambled eggs instead)..  I have noticed the red sauce and cheese sauce tend to stick because of the heat ring (again, forcing more work to stir more frequently)..  This problem can’t be minimized by allowing a frying pan to heat up 15–20 minutes, but that completely destroys inductions quick heat claim (end it minimizes, not eliminates the problem)..  similar, when I cook, rice or oatmeal, I will take it to a foaming boil, and when it settles down, the entire bottom seems to be boiling (instead of only the edges of the pan)..  Again, this creates more work on my part, to compensate for the problems caused by the ring of heat..  Alternately I could stand there and stir the rice or oatmeal, almost continuously, until the center simmers with the edges, but taking it to a foaming boil is less work.<br /><br />Even with this weakness I am starting to like induction cooking, but have to spend big money to get something better (like the control, freak burner, over $1000)..  Even the control freak has the dreaded ring of heat, but the adjustment and timer controls are very nice and intuitive.<br /><br />The other problem I have with induction ring of heat, is you cannot use smaller pots and pans (only the edge will boil as explained above, or if you’re cooking an omelette, it will stick in the area of the heat ring).  I dare you to try to heat up cheese sauce in a sauce pan. It will stick like nothing you’ve ever seen (but I think the one I was heating had a lot of milk in it)..  Anyway, I cannot use my 4 inch enameled, cast-iron, butter, warmer, that I also used to be finishing oil for rice..  To use the small pan I tried those heating disks, but they’re a pain to bother with (any pan must completely cover the ring of heat, or the software will not work).<br /><br />There are advantages to induction, you could boil something very fast.  The heat really does go into the pot instead of the kitchen..  Depending what you are cooking, the things I mentioned above may not be so annoying..  On this Duxtop burner there is a timer function, but I’ve never bothered to use it. On the dramatically over priced control freak I love the timer function and use it frequently..  I’m a control freak there is a knob for a timer, [for example], when I’m cooking oatmeal or rice, when the simmering portion begins I simply turn the knob to 10 minutes for oatmeal, longer for rice (an alarm will sound)..  The control freak has a programming feature (that I played with for a while), where the heat would turn off when the timer ends or continue (your choice)..  But it got to be too cumbersome to keep up with because if you change the pot, or the amount of oatmeal, you cook, then the timer doesn’t work anymore..  But the (CF) timers are so easy and intuitive to use, if I were simmering something for a long time, where I wanted the burner to automatically shut off, I would set it up.",1677583939710,5,true

Honestly, I think my rugs, in high-traffic areas, were staying in place better without these grippers, since they almost seem to push the rug off of the floor when the adhesive inevitably releases. They can be pushed back down, but by that time my dogs have gotten caught on it as they race out the door, or in the living room where there is no furniture on the rug it lifts, and it has actually become a bigger tripping hazard. Since the grippers can be re-adhered, they would be great for bedrooms and other areas where the rugs don't see a lot of traffic.<br /><br />The Bottom Line: At $9.99 for a 10-pack, the OUDLOR Gripper for Rug are inexpensive, but I would NOT use them in high-traffic areas.",1674617073442,0,false
3,"Useful and space saving, but not as adjustable as i'd hoped","The SZNLZQ Drink Organizer for Fridge was just a few millimeters too large depth-wise for my mini fridge where I intended to use it. Unfortunately, the way the rolling surfaces, which feed the cans forward are made they can't be altered or trimmed in any way. I then ended up using it in my regular refrigerator to hold yogurt, since the shelf where I have space can't accommodate the height of cans. While I was able to find a use for it, I simply wish the can pusher glide was modifiable.<br /><br />The Bottom Line: The SZNLZQ Soda Dispenser for Fridge is $42.99, and I feel like it's a little expensive since adjustments can only be done left to right, as in removing a pusher glide, but not front to back to adapt the length of the pusher glides.",1674513080546,0,false
3,Colorful but not thick enough to be anti-fatigue,"XIQIHEYUE Crystal Velvet Kitchen 2-piece Rug Set is supposed to be anti-fatigue, however, I found them to be thinner than other anti-fatigue kitchen mats I have used, both for commercial and home use, so while okay to stand on they don't really provide any relief when cooking for long periods. The microfiber set is easy to clean either with a stiff broom, the vacuum or by tossing them in the washing machine. While it may not provide the comfort I was hoping for, the Bohemian A design adds color to my kitchen while I continue working on remodeling it. I wouldn't necessarily call the rugs non-slip, since my dogs seem able to move the mats across the kitchen easily; although, they haven't slid for me while I've been washing dishes or cooking. Additionally, I won't say they are waterproof, though if water is spilled on them, the mats are quick drying and wash up well in the washing machine.<br /><br />The Bottom Line: For $20.99, these rugs have a fun look, though the design is printed, and while they are not anti-fatigue, they are great to stand on versus the hard floor alone and an inexpensive way to add some color to the kitchen.",1673459416445,0,false
1,Assembly should NOT be missing essential pieces; waste of cash DO NOT PURCHASE.,"The DLATRE TV Stand for TVs up to 55 inches in Rustic Brown is a huge disappointment; I feel it is absolutely imperative to be critical of the faults of this furniture unit, which should have had an uneventful and straightforward assembly, especially, due to the excellent instruction manual, its only saving grace.<br /><br />The following are the issues:<br />ONE: Upon opening the box of the DLATRE TV stand, there was styrofoam everywhere, more so than most of the furniture I have assembled, and it was as if broken and crushed pieces of styrofoam were deliberately included in the packaging. It was also annoying to remove the components from the package, in part because the box could NOT be opened flat without cutting the sides and risking damage to the unit's pieces; also because of the flying styrofoam; I'm sure I inhaled some of the microparticles and I absolutely got fine particulate in my eyes.<br /><br />TWO: The DLATRE unit itself is much, much darker than expected when compared to the pictures in the listing; while I know there might be some color variation due to my monitor, I expected a considerably warmer, richer rustic brown, but this TV stand is nearly as dark as the smaller stand it's replacing. Overall, the color is a tremendous disappointment.<br /><br />THREE: I would not recommend this DLATRE TV stand for small spaces, it seems long for a studio, and perhaps even a one-bedroom apartment. It is a bit longer than I envisioned, but I'm stuck with it now, so I'll have to make it work in the space, but I won't be able to anchor it to the wall, so I hope my cats refrain from being jerks and my dogs don't try any funny business.<br /><br />FOUR: The entire bag of hardware for the DLATRE entertainment center had two issues. First, the bag was ripped open in the box, and multiple screws fell out of the corners of the box as I moved it to where it was to be assembled, and it's a miraculous wonder none of the small pieces were lost in shipping. Second, all the hardware was sent in a single bag, and fortunately, again the ONLY positive of the TV stand, the instructions, clearly showed which piece corresponded to which letter; thankfully, the instruction manual was helpful, clear, and easy to read.<br /><br />FIVE: Now this is rather minor, but according to the description this DLATRE TV console is supposed to have TWO storage shelves; the pictures in the Amazon listing only show one shelf and there were only parts included for one shelf, so I'm assuming there is only supposed to be one shelf. However, there was room in both the packaging and on the unit itself for another shelf, and I was very surprised a second shelf was not included for inside the cabinet.<br /><br />SIX: Now for the BIGGEST issues with the DLATRE console table. The top of the unit was missing the essential plastic inserts to install the screws and secure the top of the unit, to make it sturdy. While this can be fixed using other repair methods, the point is it should NOT be necessary to fix, nor should it be my responsibility to repair the unit. It is seriously a waste of my time and trouble to repackage and return the DLATRE TV stand. To say the legs are spindly is an understatement, and there should be two extra legs in the center of the TV stand to prevent the center from bowing over time. Additionally, there are small plastic brackets that are to be installed on the back of the unit, presumably to keep the back in place when anchoring it to the wall with the anti-tip strap and installing equipment cables. However, there are no pre-drilled holes to facilitate securing the plastic brackets to the back, I managed to get one, with some difficulty, attached to the bottom back as indicated by the instructions. Though, when attempting to fasten the bracket, which should be placed to the side behind the cabinet to help stabilize this faulty DLATRE TV<br />unit, in order to see if the top could be installed safely, if at all, since the stand is particle board, my attempt to install the bracket damaged the back of the unit.<br /><br />The Bottom Line: The DLATRE Entertainment Center & Media Console is a packaging and assembly nightmare from start to finish. Even though the DLATRE TV stand is currently on sale for $96.89, about $13 off of its usual $109.89, I don't think it's a bargain; in fact, it's highway robbery, and I wouldn't pay ONE RED CENT, for this horrendous experience in a box.",1672876625418,0,false

It is 45 pages long. The book of recipes is full of repetitive information and it is 59 pages long.

The filters also disintegrated on the edges and it leaves particles of the filter in the water. Also cleaning it is not fun. I usually try to stay on top of keeping my unit clean, so I wash it every other day because it developed a slick feel on the white plastics. I am thinking of returning to the ultrasonic vaporizers, although even with reverse osmosis water it still spews out the white dust but the cleaning is much easier and no expensive filters to use.

3,Middle of the road holder. Better designs exist.,"Not much effort went into the design and manufacture of this. It's made of bamboo, cheap and plentiful, but also not that great looking without lacquer or stain, in my opinion.<br /><br />One nice thing that prevented me from giving this a 2-star review is that, even though the photos in the description show words etched or burned into the piece, the one I received was blank. So I don't have to worry about what roll goes where or even buy wax paper if I don't need it.<br /><br />The main issue is that the cutting mechanism is poorly designed. It's just not wide enough for the standard size rolls of foil, wax paper, or plastic-wrap. The grooved cutting piece is about a half-inch too short for the entire piece of foil/wrap to go across without going *on top of* the cutting slider piece. In order to cut a piece of foil, for example, you have to scrunch it up at the end where the cutter is located. This makes every piece that you cut crinkled up on the end. And it's the same way on the way back.<br /><br />The only way to solve this problem is to saw off a half inch from the roll you put in so that the piece of foil or plastic lays neatly across the cutter groove.<br /><br />Another minor issue that is that it only holds the smaller sized rolls. It's not made for the larger ones, I know, but it means I have to get another one if I want to put all my rolls in this kind of storage tool.<br /><br />The rolls also wobble back and forth inside the box because there isn't any kind of spool or axle to put them onto. Even a little wooden spacer would help.<br /><br />I thought this would be nice to mount on the inside of a cupboard door or on the wall next to the counter, but it's just too awkward and difficult to use with the cutting slider issue.<br /><br />Overall, you can make it work, but it's a clunky solution that could have been done better. I'm sure there are other models that do it better. Just keep looking. Only 3 stars for this mediocre thing.",1673741447545,1,false

2,Otdspares Fuel Tank,The tank itself is made of thick metal and is coated nicely. They even included an extra plastic fuel nipple. The con was the insert (or bung) they used to attach the fuel nipple to the tank does not fit tightly in the tank.

Also the fitting is metric thread not a std npt thread so I can appreciate them including an extra.

3,Big problem with the door design - burn hazard,"We wanted a big toaster oven and initially, I liked the French door access to fit large pans in the oven, but we soon found that the doors DON'T STAY OPEN unless you can cock them back all the way so they click.

Ours sits in the corner of our countertop and there's lots of room around it, but if anything else is put in the way while cooking - and that always happens, you can't open the doors all the way and many times we've been burned by the glass doors which heat up to the same temp as the oven.

I do love that it’s a thinner blanket as it’s easier to wash. The electric cords don’t cover the whole blanket so keep that in mind if you’re expecting that.

1,Don't fall for the same bait and switch I did,"I had decided that I was going to purchase the carpet One, non-Pro version. When I pulled up the page, I was looking at prices and the carpet One pro had a $100 off coupon available. This made the price $499 which was the same price as the non-Pro version at the time, so it seemed like a no-brainer to me. A couple of days after receiving it, I went back on Amazon to see what current prices were and I was  let down. The non-Pro version is now selling for $349. They had obviously raised the price to get people to switch just like I did, probably because they needed to unload some. I contacted them about being upset about being duped, and their solution was to offer me a free bottle of cleaning solution. I felt that was rather insulting. The carpet One pro is definitely not worth the extra money spent. The Wi-Fi function is pointless. While the LED screen is fancy, it doesn't do much more than what the non-Pro version does. I do feel like the sensor showing how dirty the area is, or the sensor showing how damp the area is, are both gimmicks. I have not noticed any consistency with either of those functions. I do feel like it is a good carpet cleaner, but definitely not for more than $349.",1673845664303,3,true

3,Meh. Just OK. But not as described and probably not suitable for an adult.,"I purchased the Twin 6 inch folding mattress for use as a guest bed. The description says it has 2 inches of memory foam atop 4 inches of high density foam.  Well in total, after fully expanded for more than 24 hours, it only expanded to just over 5 inches (5.25 inches).  When I unzip one of the  sections to get a closer look at the interior, I can clearly see that the blue memory form portion is NOT two inches as described. Not even close. It measured at 3/4 of an inch. That explains why this is only expanding to 5.25 inches in total. The second incorrect measurement is the length. Its advertised as 75"" long, but in fact only expands out to 72"" (6 feet), which is 3"" short. That's fine for a child, teen or small woman. But most adults would not find this to be long enough.  In fact, I'm a 5'3, 140lb female and it felt quite short to me. Laying on the bed itself felt comfortable enough for a guest bed purpose. It was soft, but not too soft, and seemed to support my body sufficiently. However, when I rolled onto my knees to get off the bed, I could feel the floor under my knees. This is where that extra 1.25"" of blue memory foam would have come in handy. If they hadn't skimped on the blue foam I think this could have been the perfect thickness. The width was the only accurate measurement on this whole thing, it came in at 38.5"" once fully expanded.  Folding up in order to store is easy...but without any way to keep the sections together (ie velcro or straps) and no handles or a carrying case, its cumbersome to move around and it easily unfolds as you are moving it.  They really should include a storage bag.  At this point, buying a storage bag feels like throwing good money after bad. There are some pros to this mattress: Its actually pretty comfortable. I give it 4 out of 5 for comfort. I also appreciate that the cover is removable for cleaning purposes. Finally, for a memory foam product I did not find this to be terribly smelly. I did leave it outside overnight to air out and expand some more, so that may have helped dissipate any smell. But I did not find this the smell to be overly offensive (and I'm usually quite sensitive to smells).  Bottom line...Its good and has potential to be useful to many.  But I just don't think its going to work for the purpose I bought it for...which was for a single ADULT guest to sleep on occasionally. Its just a tad too small for that. If you plan to use this for a child/teen, or in a camper van or even tent camping, then this might be just what you need. But as a guest bed for an adult...I just don't think its going to work for me. I would return this product if I could, but how? It came compressed and rolled into a small box. There is no way I am getting this thing rolled back up to fit back into the box. So I'm stuck with it. Maybe I'll use it for the grandkids some day.",1676912479741,11,true

3,"Lovely Wall Sconces, A Bit Pricey...","These wall sconces were a little difficult to install. The bars aren't totally straight, creating a slight issue with drilling the holes and then the hooks are slightly off as well. Just worth noting to check the bars and hooks on the set before installation in case they need straightening. This set does come with all the necessary hardware for installation. All of that being said, they are a lovely set. Very large and bold; they definitely make a statement. The design is bold, whereas the actual metal framework is lightweight. They could go with almost any decor. They are what I would refer to as simplistic beauty. Very classy. They hang well once installed and do come with flameless LED candles. The candles however are NOT operated by a remote control. That's a little annoying, having to lift each candle and switch it on or off for use each time. For the price of this set they should definitely come with remote controlled candles instead. The candles are very realistic looking do have a flickering effect when switched on. The glow they emit is really quite nice and they have a real wax feel to them. This set is kind of pricey imo. $50 for a set of wall sconces that have slightly kilter/uneven bars and flameless candles that have to be switched on by hand is a bit much. Would have been better priced around $35 or so. Overall, this is a lovely set and would make a great addition to any decor in any room but is a little overpriced imo. I would recommend getting a set of remote controlled candles if purchasing this set. You'll be glad you did! I do recommend this set overall, but have deducted 2 stars for price, candles, and slightly askew craftsmanship.",1676139508833,0,false

I had to put a clamp at the bottom just to keep it from jutting out to the left and into my mirror.

If you need a charging station, chances are, all your outlets are filled. So when it comes to the light underneath, it needs to be plugged into a USB outlet. This means you either have to use one of your charging stations USB outlets, or have an adapter in the wall plug behind the table. If that's not a problem for you, this might work. Or just don't add the light under the table. They could easily have had a third USB outlet underneath to plug the lights into, but they just made this really awkward instead.",1673967261003,0,false
3,"Cheap pumps, weird labels, but bottles are ok","I love that these bottles are glass, but I'm not thrilled with the gold plastic pumps. They work, but they're very cheaply made with low quality plastic. Also, the labels have a weird brand name on them with the saying ""Make every day colorful"" on them. I'm all for inspirational sayings, but that's just weird on a coffee syrup dispenser! I'm Using these temporarily, but won't refill unless I can find better pumps to fit these. I'm also printing my own Avery labels instead of these.",1673900111725,0,false
1,"Wrong item received, too small anyway","I fell in love with the way these look, but received martini glasses instead of these when I ordered.

3,"Tray is ok, phone holder too small","I liked the concept of this, and it works as stated on the arm of the sofa. The wood is food quality, it's well finished,  and it's an overall sturdy piece. The spring hinges arms hold the table well to a larger armed sofa, and I think it would work just as well on smaller arms since the spring hinges work so well. The problems arise with the phone holder. It's just too small of a slot for phones with covers. And really, we all have covers of various widths. A lot of thought was put into the phone holder because it works well - the little circle actually swivels to whatever direction you want, but it's attached and useless unless you remove the cover.<br />The size of this tray is nice - it can hold a small plate or bowl of snacks. I like it for my dippers or sides. We eat while watching TV often, and if I'm using more than one plate (salad bowl, for instance), this can hold one while I switch. I don't like this for drinks that are open top because it's just not quite sturdy enough to stay in place without wobbling on a reclining seat, and though I've not had a spill yet, I place coffee or tea mugs on the side table instead of this for safety.",1673713842778,0,false
3,Good for low beds or by a bean bag chair,"This is much smaller than most side tables, but perfect if your bed is low or you have lower seating. Great for teens or kids that have those low gaming chairs, or for Ikea style low bed frames. The charging station works well and the table was pretty simple to assemble, except the lower shelf was awkward for one person so having a helper to keep it in place while you get the screws started is a good idea. It's ok, nothing special at all, just small and the description photos are terribly misleading when it comes to size - the dimensions included are accurate, but the photos are just badly photoshopped.",1673539098734,0,false
3,Not as sturdy as I'd like,"This looked like it would be a really great storage cart, but it's kind of just... ok. It's one of those hard-to-review items because I don't have a lot of bad things to say about it, but not a lot of good, either. First, one of the baskets came with a lot of scratches inside. I think it was tested with cats, mice, or both! Second, the baskets are easily removeable. This feature could be good, or bad, depending on how that plays out. Moving it empty, the baskets fall off easily. Getting them back in place is tricky. The baskets are suspended on plastic arms, and when they're empty, a slight movement sends them flying in all directions outward when you move it. When weighted with stuff, that puts a lot of pressure on the arms, so I hope it's engineered to withstand that without breaking. I love the convenience of the baskets being able to swing in and out, and also be removed, which makes this great in the kitchen. That's perfect for household members with any level of ADHD because you can see everything and access it all easily, which helps with 'out of sight, out of mind' object permanence issues.<br />Overall, I think this might work great for some people, but I'm so struggling to find the good or the bad - it's truly just 'ok'!",1673538510963,0,false
2,Adequate key & mail holder,"This is an adequate key and mail holder and barely an ok value. It's made from lightweight wood and requires some assembly. The main problem is that the shelf is off by about 1/8"" so it looks like something that was in the discount bin at the dollar store. I mean, it does the job, and it hangs on the wall easily, but looks very cheap and poor quality.",1673121432953,0,false
3,Difficulties with this,"So my first evaluation was that the black paint is chipped off on several places of the legs. it was simply plastic wrapped in the box, so hard to tell if it was like that before or during the journey here. The legs also are hard to get off and onto the table. The legs attach at two different heights so it can be about a TV tray height, or a little lower. The legs can't stay attached if you want to fold it up, you have to take the legs off and store in two parts if you want it flat. The tabletop looks nice, but it's a bit rough. Maybe good for beach or camping, yard, patio, etc.",1673052138554,0,false
3,Fit well,"These fit my Oreck upright cordless very well. They're not HEPA filters, so not great if you have allergies, but good otherwise.

3,Confused,"I'd been searching for a good herbal infuser for a long time, to make regular food items like garlic butter or rosemary oil.

You know, the kind that they use terms like ""Herbal"" to get past the sensors to sell paraphernalia. I know the machine works the same way, but I'm just very put off that the whole thing is one big ruse.

3,"So much work, not the sturdiest","This cabinet is ok, but not a great value. It took so long to assemble, and there are minor flaws in several places.

I like the color contrast from natural wood to the soft gray, and I'm happy with how it looks built, but the value is more like discount furniture store, so is pretty much overpriced.",1672552023585,0,false
3,"Nice, but not very sturdy","This is a really nice looking bookcase/storage cabinet, and I love the style, but I'm concerned about the strength.

3,"Ok, needs more contrast","When you have household members with ADHD, it's vital to label everything or you won't ever have order in the house.

I'm only using half of these since some don't apply, and I'd love to have some that aren't in the set. I'd like meats and condiments - I don't use 'deli' because I stack all my meats in one bin - sausages, lunchmeat, hot dogs, etc. And one for cheese instead of 'dairy'. Anyway, these are ok, but not great.",1672548682394,0,false

Also, the measuring cup doesn't snap on or sit very tightly on it, so I am forever bumping it off and chasing it across the counters or floor.

3,Flawed.,"I love the small size as it's for my office. It's fairly expensive so I expected little to no flaws. Didn't notice at first because I was so excited to finally receive it after waiting a week and a half for delivery, I was sent the wrong product. Waiting another week and a half for the correct one, I immediately opened it to run it and get the new appliance smell out. Which didn't go away after about a dozen uses. What I was really upset about was the metal rack, it's so crooked that when its in the door doesn't close all the way. The box is so big and I already went thru the hassle of waiting three weeks for this thing it's not even worth it to exchange at this point.<br /><br />Pros: it's easy to use. Fits in small spaces and heats quickly.<br /><br />Cons: cooks very unevenly. Rack is mis shaped so the door won't close right. The racks and trays sit too high so things burn easily if you don't flip food quickly.",1676851185191,1,true

3,"Nice, but quaility has gone down","I bought the Gray Chambray Table Cloth and matching Cloth Napkins in May 2019. I like the simple country chic design, and washability. The cotton cloth does shrink, so keep this in mind when picking a size. Gentle stretching between washing and drying, and when checking progress of drying can help with shrinkage. The 2019 Table Cloth got a few stains I can't remove, so I bought another Gray Chambray Table Cloth in December 2022. The Table Cloth from 2022 is thinner, rougher, and the weave seems to have a lower threat count (or something else about the weave has changed). The white stripes are less defined because of the difference in the weave. The 2022 Table Cloth also came with some white threads woven in erroneous places, which I am trying to remove. I am disappointed that the quaility of the Table Cloth has gone down so much in 3 years. I am not sure if this is a temporary pandemic-related, or inflation-related change, or what. I'm not returning the 2022 Table Cloth even though it's not as nice as the 2019 one, but I'm undecided as to whether I'll keep buying from this company. I've taken off one star because quality of the Cloth has noticeably gone down from 2019 and taken off a second star for the white thread error.",1676946068356,1,true

2,Not a fan,"The pros:<br />I immediately washed/dried when I received it, and it came out with barely a wrinkle. It dried quickly as well. The few wrinkles it did have were easily shaken/smoothed out once on the bed. That was impressive. So it is definitely ""easy care"".<br />This duvet cover is sheer, very lightweight, and whisper quiet. It has a very soft/cottony feel to it that is smooth, but not slippery like a sateen finish (sort of like your favorite oversized white button-up cotton blouse that you've washed a zillion times). It did not add any thickness, warmth or weight. My comforter already feels ""barely there/feather light/puffy airy"", and this cover didn't change that experience...which is great if that's what you are going for. It does provide more of a ""bunch it up around you/lost in the sheets/snuggly"" feel VS just the insert comforter and a sheet alone.<br />The cons:<br />The material is thin and definitely not worth $42.99. Fortunately I got it on sale for $20. It shows any and every lump, bump or uneven area of the insert (and the outline of some of the box stitched squares of the insert including the dark shadow around the squares). I purchased the white... So perhaps ymmv with a darker color choice. To avoid all that you have to put in extra effort making the bed to get a smooth look (by carefully and lightly pulling around all the edges). It looks neat and tidy when finished...but a shame they didn't make it a bit thicker.<br />The included shams were a disappointment simply because the material is too limp around the border edges to be used for display shams...But are suitable as basic pillowcases.<br />Would I recommend this?<br />No. This material is too thin and limp to be practical as a duvet cover or sham. If it were just a bit thicker and not a hassle to smooth out every day, then it would be perfect.",1676500245783,0,true

3,"Nice but very small, not practical usage","I saw this sugar dispenser and as a baker, plus my son is a big coffee drinker, I thought this would be the perfect sugar dispenser.  I really liked the feature that it will measure out exact amounts of sugar. However, there are several cons about this product.<br /><br />1. When it comes down to it, it's not very practical for the measuring feature.  While it does work, it's more an inconvenience in the way you have to change out the measuring part than just picking up a set of measuring spoon, which is much faster that trying to change out the piece to measure different amounts.<br /><br />2. It is much much smaller than I expected it to be.  I didn't really pay attention to the size, and really wish I would have.  I probably would not have purchased it if I realized how small it was compared to my last sugar dispenser.<br /><br />3. The size of it makes it really hard to wash down inside and get the corners as opposed to having it round like most sugar dispensers.  My scrubbers don't wash the corners well at all.<br /><br />4. It is made of what seams really cheap plastic.  I am certain that the first accidental drop will have it cracking or breaking, plus I worry about having to remove the silver part constantly or the turning the tiny dial to change out the measuring piece.<br /><br />5. If you have large fingers or suffer from arthritis, this is definitely not the product for you.  There is a dial you have to turn to pull out too release the ""silver ""level"" on the front.  Large fingers or issues with things like arthritis is certain going to impede that process for you.<br /><br />We will not be changing out the measuring piece and have decided to leave it setup for 1 teaspoon.  In a household like mine, I am certain that the plastic pieces that you need to swap out to get different measurements will soon get lost.  Another waste of space in my junk drawer.  Plus it's very impractical to change them out constantly.  You're really better off sticking to  your measuring spoons.<br /><br />Overall, I am not really happy with this product, but decided to keep it.<br />Would I recommend it? No.  It's to small, made of cheap plastic and very impractical.",1676633308300,1,true

3,A blender shouldn't leak like this,"I was really happy to get this blender, hoping to replace my old one. I read the very limited instructions.

My first use, I filled it and tried to make a smoothie and suddenly there was milk everywhere. It was a real mess. I re-read the instructions, such as they are, to see what i had done wrong. I unscrewed the bottom and took out the gasket and put it all back together and tried it again. The second time it didn't leak but I have found that if you aren't super careful to put the sealing ring with gasket on just right it is going to leak. I had expected so much more from a company like Oster. I am keeping my old blender and I will probably only use this one when I don't have a lot of liquid to blend. The blender needs to be plugged in and turned on for the different programs to show.

Because it’s metal, to use it you have to use a glove to avoid burning yourself.  Notice Atlas: nice and big, made of wood, angles outward and up. No burnt hands and no need to wear glove…which isn’t helpful for stir frying. Who can handle chopsticks or a typical wok metal spatula if you have a glove on?

But…<br /><br />…The large metal attachment is actually on the handle, not at the end like it is on the Atlas. I burned myself several times.

But not this one model… It sat upstairs on carpet.. in a 72 degree room for 4 days prior to anyone sleeping on it. I had to refill it daily. The box does state it can deflate for 2-3 days in order for the material to stretch.. That’s just not it.. they need to find out what else is going on. It had to be reinflated nightly for a 100pound person sleeping on it. In all fairness it’s not loosing all the air.. but about a fifth of the mattress. I feel it’s a manufacturing issue.

The main ones with the springs will rock side-to-side as you move things around, grab utensils or whatever items you've organized, or putting them away, and when that happens the small dividers fall out of the grooves they're held in! It's not worth the hassle. If you want them for looks alone and aren't planning on using the items in them, then go for it. They do in fact make everything look nice and neat.

The photos show what happened after running it through the dishwasher.  It looks similar to what an aluminum pan looks like after going through a dishwasher.  The pan did look very nice before the dishwasher but not so much after.  It is a sturdy pan.  The one star is for the fact that the pan is not stainless steel as advertised.  If they advertised this as an aluminum pan I would not have an issue with it.  I would just hand wash it as I do with all of my other aluminum pans.,1675280361288,0,true

I tried to cook simple eggs on medium heat on this griddle, not only was it sticking to the pan, I had a hard time removing the eggs without breaking it onto the plate.  Anyway, as you can see in the photos, it left behind a lot of the eggs on the pan.  To it's credit, it was easy to clean except for the browning or patina on the side of the pan depicted in the second photo.  I am sorry but I do not think it performs even close to what I expected a $140 pan should perform like.  I could cook better eggs on a $10 non stick pan.

3,Good Concept - Poor Execution,"I realize a company's main goal is to make profit,  but for the cost of this item I expected greater quality and better quality control.<br />Yes, it is a novelty item with a double rod, and a God send for those of us who have nowhere to put a towel rod. That said, they could have done so much better for the price. Here are my complaints:<br />1. The brackets are shiny stainless steel and the rods are brushed aluminum made to look like brushed Nickel, but a little too much on the rosy side. It looks kind of cheap that they don't match (see photos).<br />2. The machining on the stainless steel brackets is horrendous, please do better at this price point (see photo).<br />3. My rods arrived in an undamaged box, but one of the rod ends was misshapen making it more difficult to thread in (see photo).<br />4. Where rod ends were cut in a V shape to fit on curved end, this was not soldered or fixed well and that V shape end is extremely sharp, as nor has it been smoothed and de-burred (see photo).<br />As a final product, I would not hang more than one, maybe two towels, but it does look nice once installed,  although more rosy tinted than brushed nickel. I do not think the quality warrants the price.",1678650557028,0,true

Maybe there's a time limit for storing textiles that I wasn't aware of?

1,Screen itself is cheap and the holes are too large to prevent embers from escaping.,"I knew it was going back as soon as I got a close look at this product.  The screen is of very low quality and the openings are too large to use with a real fire.  Some of the logs we burn occasionally crackle and pop, and some of the embers could easily escape through this screen.  The screen we are replacing (for the sake of style) has openings that are about 1/4 the size of the openings on this.  We'll use our existing one rather than risk using this Christopher Knight screen.  Too bad.  Stylistically, it appeared to be more of what we wanted, but functionally and in terms of quality, it was easy to see that this was the wrong choice and needed to be returned immediately.",1674311620300,0,true
1,Very poor quality screen. Not keeping it.  Would be embarrassing.,"I thought that the simple design would be effective, but the quality - especially of the screen itself - is so poor that I didn't even unwrap it fully before coming to the conclusion that I was going to return it.  The screen almost appears to be made of plastic rather than any form of metal / alloy.  (To be clear, I'm sure it's not actually plastic, but that's what it looks and feels like.) The screen is not only warped and poorly attached to the frame, but the openings in the screen are too large to keep some embers from the fire from escaping.  I'm surprised by the number of people who seem to buy these things to keep pets and children out of their fireplace, but maybe that's the market for this.  It's not what I would trust to prevent embers from escaping the fireplace.  Glad Amazon made it easy to return.  Too bad that Amazon is a marketplace filled with such crap though.",1674311265939,0,true

3,Imbalanced with pedal. Big issue.,"This can is attractive but I can't understand all the positive reviews. For me, I knew it was a risk to replace my Simplehuman step can with butterfly lid, but I really wanted a larger can in white (for a space that wouldn't work with any larger Simplehuman cans). Every time I push the foot pedal to open the lid, the can slides a CM or inch back across the wood floor. This is not flat piece of metal, and the lift mechanism sticks out quite a bit from the rear. Nevertheless, a regular step to open it will send the lightweight lid back a full 90 degrees. If you have the can flush against your wall, the lid will slam against your wall when you open it. If you move it away from the wall, it won't stay still on the floor. I put a kettlebell weight in the bottom (which reduces capacity) to keep it from moving as easily, but it still moves. Additionally, the proper fit bags are not strong, nor are they available in any scented versions that I could find. I support that ecofriendly bags but they're as dysfunctional as this can.

2,Horrible quality,"The only reason I didn't give this 1 star is because the seller tried to make things right. However, the process was long and difficult, and there was a language barrier.<br /><br />For starters, the vanity is very difficult to put together, despite years of building Ikea furniture (this is worse). There were over 10 pages of instructions and basically nothing was assembled. You have to put all 200+ pieces together, and even the rails on the drawers are not attached. It also took forever to separate the pieces from all the loose styrofoam bits.<br /><br />Once we started putting the pieces together, we noticed:<br />(1) the chair was dirty and dented,<br />(2) the vanity legs had - what only can be described as - a vein running through it,<br />(3) the handles are unevenly painted and made of cheap plastic,<br />(4) many of the particle boards were chipped,<br />(5) the mirror was broken and didn't close all the way, and<br />(6) the mirror had black marks all over it.<br /><br />We paid over $300 for the vanity and it looked like something out of a toy store. The biggest disappointment was that we opened the mirror last, and noticed it had a corner dented, didn't close all the way (until we put in our own drill holes) and had black marks on it. If we opened this first, I would have put everything back in and sent it back. Of course, the mirror is packaged quite deep in the box in its own box and we didn't notice until we started installing it.<br /><br />The seller did try to make things right but his initial solution was to mail us another one as a free replacement, or to mail this one back for a refund. Seeing as we put together the whole thing already, we only wanted some of the parts, like the handles and chair, but he was still offering to send the whole thing. We finally agreed on a partial refund. He also said he would refund part of the $70 shipping costs, when the package was delayed and I took off work waiting to receive it, but that was never done.<br /><br />Overall, this was not a good transaction and the product is low quality. It looks like the vanity is no longer available but in case this is offered again, I would caution buyers against this vanity until they sort out the quality issues. It does fit very nicely in the space and has way more storage than most vanities, but the problem is that I'm scared to use it because of its flimsiness.",1672625161465,0,true

The non-skid feature is also a nice touch and keeps the bag from slipping out of your hand during use. The 18-inch size is also perfect for most decorating tasks.<br /><br />However, the outside of the bag is very sticky, which can make it difficult to use and store.

Further, the hand is connected / welded directly to the kettle which means you'll need to either wear a mitt, or find someone who crochets to put something else around the handle.

However, no matter what candles I use, it simply does not spin. I am able to spin it manually, but it does not work as described. I may have been sent a defective unit. One of the penguins was broken and lying inside the box, and I had to glue it back on to its feet, and there was a small wooden piece that fell out of the middle when I opened the box. I tried the small tealight sized candles and even taller candles and nothing makes it spin.

3,Just didn't seem to hold it's edge as long as I feel it should have.,"I bought the Zelite Infinity Damascus Chef Knife 8 Inch about six months ago and I have been using it for various cooking tasks; cutting meats like chicken and pork and various vegtables. The knife is very well-made and has a beautiful Damascus pattern on the blade. The handle is comfortable and ergonomic, and the balance is good. The knife came razor-sharp and cut through everything with ease.<br /><br />However, after six months of use, I noticed that the edge was starting to slightly dull. I always used the knife on a wood cutting board and never put it in the dishwasher or used it for hard foods like bones or frozen items. I expected the knife to retain its sharpness for longer, considering its high price and quality materials and the much lighter use than an actual chef would have put in.<br /><br />Therefore, I gave this knife 3 stars out of 5. It is still a good knife but not as sharp as it used to be. Maybe I need to get it professionally sharpened or use a whetstone to restore its edge. I hope this review helps other potential buyers who are looking for a durable and sharp chef knife.",1677510859140,1,true

You want the mold to lay flat so that most of the water sinks to the sides. Then, remove the mold from the bag and chip away at the ice until it's just the mold full of ice with a bit of ice around the domes on the top.

2,"But seriously, why does this fit 2.5 pairs across??","Apparently I’ve had this 4 years now which is amazing because I hate it. Seriously hate it. 1.) it holds 2.5 pairs of shoes per row. Doesn’t matter if it’s a child’s or adults. I don’t want to have one shoe on one row and the matching shoe on another. That seriously stresses me out. 2.) the stupid poles are always falling out. I’m sure glue would fix this beautifully. Why haven’t I glued it? Because I always swear I’m going to replace it and I can’t be bothered, but obviously I never do 3.) toddler shoes fall through it which is probably the only shoes I had a chance of putting 3 pairs in a row. The bars are too far apart to support both the heal and toe. 4.) when I fill the whole thing up my door sags just enough that I have to pull up for the door latch to match up and click closed so it doesn’t slowly swing back open 5.) shoes fall off all the time when I shut the door. They either fall through or a poles fall, or it swings when I shut the door and the impact when it falls back knocks them off. I seriously hate this thing.<br /><br />I WILL say the materials are solid and aren’t going to break (just fall apart).  The design looks much better than the fabric ones. I like that the rows fold up if not in use even though I never actually use that feature, so I guess that’s a novelty.<br /><br />But seriously, I hate this product with a passion. Just talking about it makes me want to call my therapist. When I finally take it down, I may go Office Space on this when I finally replace it.<br /><br />I doubt I’d be any happier with another over-the-door shoe organizer. I’m going to go with a free standing shelf, but space is not my issue. If you are really tight on space this product is probably as good as you’re going to get.

I have read that people have said it is hard to open after a while and that is another issue he didn't have but that again could be because his hands are so large.<br /><br />His biggest complaint is that you can't fit larger pickles in this. You have stick with the little ones and we're pretty sure spears would never fit.<br /><br />Finally in the words of my husband- ""A fork works just as well"". :-) However, if you want your pickles fast and don't want to try to chase them around the jar with a fork this might be the thing for you.",1675100980451,0,false

3,"Great price, but mediocre lids.","These are not horrible water bottles, especially considering the very reasonable price and all that comes with it, but the lids could be a lot better. I have 2 of these bottles, one that is 18oz and says dishwasher safe, I am guessing because of the more textured paint job? The other one is 22oz, says only the lids are dishwasher safe and it has a more smooth paint on it. For reference, the 18oz one is currently $15.99 and the 22oz one is currently $16.99.<br /><br />- The bottles themselves seem nice. The top lip of the metal bottle is nicely smoothed and comfortable for drinking.<br /><br />- The paint job seems nicely done and looks nice. I can see the seam of the wrap on the pink one, but it doesn't bother me at all.<br /><br />- I like how the 'bjakak' branding mostly blends in, because really I don't want to see that or have that there.<br /><br />- It was nice that they came with extra straws (2 straws came with each bottle) and they came with a nice straw cleaning brush.<br /><br />- The flex lid seems fine. The handle part is bendy and flexible.<br /><br />- The spout opens and closes easily and securely, however the edge on the spout is a bit uncomfortable to drink from.<br /><br />- On the straw lid, the straw part has to be 100% open to work, yet the straw moves easily so it is easily bumped out of being 100% open and then it just sucks air. It also does take some effort to get the water up, I think due to a narrow piece where the straw attaches.<br /><br />- No leaks. I have tried out all of the lids, shaking the bottle and flipping them upside-down and have had no leaks when they are all closed. When they straw part is open, of course it will leak if flipped over, so that's not the best for throwing into a bag carelessly in case the straw gets bumped into open position.<br /><br />Overall, they work but I would prefer something else. I have another bottle with a straw that stays open much better, and I have a spout Camelbak bottle that has a much better lid.",1678204203578,0,false

I machine washed it with cold water and a light wash cycle, as the rug says to. It only shed a tiny bit in my washing machine, but as I previously noted, more pieces are sticking up higher than the others and the edging started to unravel some. It also somehow managed to get softer, which feels great; I wish the pieces were staying in better!<br /><br />I bought this for my kids to sit on while playing with toys in our basement and despite the lose pieces I think it will work alright for a while, but I would not get it again.",1675746122293,0,false

But the issue we're having is that the carafe does not slide onto the heating element smoothly. It almost doesn't fit at all. As a result we have to fight with it to slide it back in place after we pour coffee. So it never stays hot because it does not sit correctly on the heating element.

Luckily I was still able to find a use for it, but over padding that I had in my son's nursery. Any time I would put him down barefoot, my feet would stick to the padding making a noise going out. So sometimes I would wake him up if I wasn't extremely careful. So putting this on the padding, I can now exit quietly! I haven't vacuumed it yet though, and still worried about that with how shaggy it is. I wanted to originally put it in my living room as we just got rid of our carpet and went to tile. But it's not thick enough to give us any kind of cushion for my son if he falls.

Coating works fine, so that's great.<br /><br />Women up this morning and found my pan hook broke over night and this pan fell 6 feet to the lanolin below. Handle is wobbly now, but worse yet, the opposite side of the pan is terribly bent. On a whim I looked to see if I could work the bend out by hand.... surprisingly I can. Never thought this pan would last forever, but I at least thought it would be sturdy.<br /><br />Now the issue with misen. They have a life time warrenty. We are sold these pans on that lifetime warrenty. But the warenty is denied for two reasons, 1, damage from drops. Part of me gets this, but part of me is a bit ticked about that.. 2, non-stick pans do not get warranties. This non stick pan has no factory warrenty because in their words they are designed to be disposable. That one really gets me. These nonstick pans are junks and misen knows it. Don't buy, of you receive a dud out of the box, you are SOL according to misen. I fought this point with a customer service representative and they sent me a discount code to help cover the cost difference in replacing the pan. I applied the code but it was rejected by their system as non a supported item for the discount.<br /><br />That's a joke. Stay away from misen.

Auto shutoff after 2 hours is great if you’re absent minded. The add-water warning was helpful in making me realize I forgot to switch from individual brew to the pot option.  The individual brew is nice option but messy. If the cup isn’t right up there under the drip coffee splatters everywhere, I’ve tried a variety of cup sizes/widths, even the tall travels. Water tank for the pot is a little awkward since it has such a slim mouth. I use a reusable filter in the pot side, the paper filters (some included which was nice) kept folding over. With the reusable have had no grounds make their way into the pot.<br />About once a week I have to set something heavy on top of the brew basket cover because one corner will randomly pop up.<br />With all of the little things, Was debating sending back but return window closed.<br /> For a programmable pot under $100 it’s acceptable. Could have gotten for less with a used one, but this is one appliance I’ll always buy brand new.",1675864705898,2,true

2,Don't get it,"So I got this item a bit over a year ago to replace a really cheap and crappy one I paid 10 dollars for. That 10 dollar unit was better than this one by a LONG MILE.<br /><br />The good:<br /><br />Okay, so it cooks food. It's a convection oven like all ""air fryers"" and as it doesn't need to heat up like a traditional oven it's pretty convenient for a lot of foods.<br /><br />Size: pretty decent size cooking bucket<br /><br />The bad:<br /><br />Okay so first, that new smell is going to linger for MONTHS. It was maybe about 7-8 months of smell before it finally disappeared all together and the first month you could taste it in the food, so a lot of food was tossed out. Luckily the taste went away and it became usable.<br /><br />Flimsy: You can tell a lot of parts are just cheap and what is worse is there are no replacement parts to find (just tried to look and nothing, not even a way to just buy the whole bucket again). So Oster doesn't care about creating landfill, this breaks, it's landfill. As such, the development team and CEO and other board members should probably be put on charges and put in jail for the rest of their lives and have all their wealth stripped from them as ecological terrorists, but I digress, let's continue with this piece of dog poo.<br /><br />Cleaning: So this was LITERALLY one of the things they claim is superior about this product. and to be fair, the outer bucket that catches a lot of the excess fat and crumbs cleans like a breeze. The bucket where your food goes, well, that's another story. Be prepared to get tired scrubbing because if you want a clean bucket it's going to cost you a LOT of elbow grease and an entire sponge to waste after it gets dirty beyond use after you use it.",1672969350324,1,true

1,Ureliable - likely to remain so,"Having good care, it stopped working during the coldest period of its second season.  No value in having paid extra for this brand.  Quite the contrary, portable heaters that I've purchased for 1/2 or less the cost of this Vornado, have all provided better service.<br /><br />While its 5-year Warranty is part of its price, necessity can make that Warranty moot:  Heaters failing during Winter require a replacement.  Not a pack for shipping, trip to the Post Office, then start the waiting process.  For this reason or because of shipping costs. Or, as in my case, determining a poorly-chosen part failed. And repairing would just mean this nuisance will be recurring.  With Winter infringing on my family's living spaces, and plumbing possibly at risk.  It was necessary to purchase a new heater locally, at full in-season price.<br /><br />My Vornado heater became inoperable due to its fan motor seizing up.  On my inspection, I found the Factory had chosen the cheaper alternative to a more durable motor.  At Factory level, the more durable would have fractional added expense.  And this product's selling price well-validates use of the more durable.  Lacking that, the product will remain short-serving between repairs; so it's substantially overpriced.  Even in-service, this Vornado product's thermostat was prone to 'sticking', keeping the heater running indefinately.  Requiring its thermostat to be turned almost to complete minimum, to shut the heater off. Then re-establishing a setting.  The nuisance of having to 'check up on' this heater was ongoing.<br /><br />Ocassional product breakdowns and glitches are understood and accepted.  But for the reasons given, I would not recommend this heater.  It represents an overall poor choice, in an appliance where reliability is more critical.",1674742278625,0,true

2,There are much better products . Customer service is great,"Now that we have actually used every piece an accurate review is in order,  The ONLY good thing I can say is the interior finish is easy to clean thus far.  The BAD part is every pan and pot  in this set, except two,  are warped or concave on the bottom and prevent the pan or pot from sitting properly on the gas stove top.. This causes the colored edges of the pot/pan, instead of the designed  cooking bottom,  to  rest on the burner causing the surface color to scratch right off in only a few uses.  It also makes any oils used in cooking to flow right to the edges. leaving almost the entire bottom void instead of covering the entire bottom. Not good for cooking eggs or other things you don’t want to stick to the pain.  The metal handles do not remain cool to the touch in fact at times get very hot.  Needless to say we are extremely disappointed in this company’s product.<br />Update February 10, 2023  perhaps we were just unlucky to get a bad set.  Happens from time to time with almost every product including cars.  After an exchange of a few emails with the company they did stand behind their product/customer service and did provide us a refund on the product.

3,Unstable Interface to Alexa,"It was a delight for one year then suddenly Alexa went all stupid (as Alexa periodically does) and claimed  the starter was ""not responding."" I suspect the problem came with an ""upgrade"" to the Alexa system rather than any change to the Durablow but Amazon admits nothing, of course. The unit was very difficult to install because 1. squirming around on my belly with a flashlight peering under the firebox is strenuous for me, and 2. It took me a long time to understand the wiring of the fireplace and the Durablow, and how they go together. Once installed, I could say ""Alexa, One hour fire,"" and be sure that after an hour, the fire would go off even if I forgot about it and went to bed. Now I am back to using the wall switch and my memory (!).  Cannot find any customer support from Durablow or Amazon. I am loathe to go through the squirming business again so for now, the ""not-so-smart"" relay is out of service.  what I need is a millivolt relay wired in-line to a Kasa smartswitch, but can't find that.<br />UPDATE: After ten days, I barked the Alexa command out of habit and the fireplace started. It's working again. I did nothing. So obviously, it was a problem in the Wifi interface between Alexa and Durablow that mysteriously resolved itself.

If you are going to have them as a feature then they should be correct and if not then its just a silicone mat but that has some problems as well. It's really floppy and rather thin so its hard to store and unroll without it holding a seam or fold mark. It doesn't have any internal webbing like baking sheets so its kind of unruly.<br /><br />It is better than nothing hence the two stars, it makes clean up easier and when you get it placed and flush on the counter it is nice to work on but don't use a blade scraper or knife as it would definitely cut. It has a ridge around the outside which I do really like, that gives it a small edge which also helps keeping the area clean and easier to cleanup. The larger size is also nice but overall the incorrect measurements and it being as thin and floppy make me feel other options would be better. Check out my photos for a closer look and I hope this helped.",1678762480552,0,false
3,"Great size, color to the glass, and design. The glass has several bubbles in it 2 you can feel.","I love bedside carafes, I think they are great in so many different situations and these types with the glass as a lid are just perfect. This carafe is really great overall, the only reason for the lower review is the glass I received has several bubbles in it (check photos). Two of them you can feel and one, on the side of the carafe, is so thin you can feel it from the inside and out and I worry if it cracks or the bubble ""pops""  I'll have a glass jar with a small hole in the side. The glass also has bubbles in the base and rim with 6-7 total in the two pieces.<br /><br />Currently is doesn't cause any problems in the use, but the one worries me long term and it's more than you'd really want to see in a product. The glass otherwise is clean and well made. I love the green color, and also how there are no seam marks. The lid fits the base carafe perfectly and both pieces fit well in the hand, and are a good thickness. Check out my photos for a closer look, measurements and I hope this helped.",1678596891287,0,false
3,Not all metal parts are stainless steel and its louder than other grinders I have used.,"[[VIDEOID:16895faaf9c9db15b80129fc6d7d53f9]] So this grinder has quite a few pros and things I really like. It has a locking button so the grinder body stays in place and can't move or shift during use. It comes with 2 grinding plates with different diameter holes for different size grinds. Everything fits together well, snug and is easy to assemble and it all comes apart easy to get to all areas for cleaning. Also the grinder is a good weight, it feels like it is put together well and doesn't slide around during use.<br /><br />For all the pros it has a few big negatives as well. First and the biggest problem I have is that not all the metal parts appear to be stainless steel. The grind plates and blade are stainless and the metal on the body of the grinder motor seems to be wrapped in stainless but the grind tray, body, lock ring and worm seem like a plated metal. You are told on the machine and instructions to not wash them in the dishwasher or even with hot water. Thats just weird, any kitchen item needs to be durable, its a tool and needs to be able to handle the job and if these parts were made out of stainless they could handle that. The machine when its running is also rather loud, check video.<br /><br />Overall its a nice grinder, good weight, easy to use, put together and take apart. Not all the parts being stainless is the biggest disappointment. Check out my photos and video for a closer look and I hope this helped.",1678595292700,0,false
3,"Great as a portable couch or for kids sleeping, still has room for improvement though.","[[VIDEOID:e1a4013a356b913b21176dac9b1d0d48]] We are going to use this in the RV, set it up under the awning as a mobile couch and I think it will work great for this application. I wouldn't think of this as a go to for a sleeping air mattress, when you lay on it in the  open configuration the crease or space between the two, ends up right at my waist (I am a six foot man) and its a little uncomfortable. It would be great for kids, each side could fit a smaller kid perfectly.<br /><br />Again, I think this is great as a mobile blow up couch, although when my wife and I are both on it, it is not as comfortable as with just one of us. It deforms a bit, mostly the back rest area. You could set the whole thing up easily in under ten min, each section blows up in a little over a min. It comes with a plug in pump and it works well but it has a pretty high pitched sound when using it (check video).<br /><br />Overall, Its a great option for kids or a mobile couch. I believe this will work great with the RV and my kiddo already loves playing on it. It comes with a carry tote although some of the stitching is already coming loose. It's a great idea but still has several areas that could be better. Take a look at my photos for a closer look and I hope this helped.",1674873485926,0,false
3,Had really high hopes for this but there are some weird problems I have with it.,"First off it is heavy, something you want for a cast iron cookware, weight=heat retention. The idea for this is great and the griddle part works well but it has some shortcomings. First the finish on this doesn't seem like a regular natural cast iron on the griddle part and the grate seems like a really raw finish. In the photo you can see there is a part that was rubbed and it looks like it is coated or sprayed with a nonstick finish? This has stayed after cleaning and the first use. The grate is rough, and has sharpish edges but it feels like the metal has small voids, like it wasn't fully homogenous when formed. When using it the griddle part worked well but the grate has little feet that are on both sides (the grate can be removed and flipped over) so it kind of lifts it from the base and doesn't have barely any physical contact. It ends up getting 95%ish of its heat transfer from radiant heat. I used it in my grille and it did heat up but I don't feel like it got as hot and worked as well as it could or as well as the griddle did.<br /><br />I have maybe 12-14 different cast iron pans and love cooking with cast iron. I was hoping for a bit more from this and while it works alright, the finish and scratch to the finish and the rough quality for the grate and being that it didn't perform as well as I had hopped left me underwhelmed. It works well as a griddle and has a good weight to it but I feel the details on this could be better and I really wanted a better sear function from the grate. It might season better with continued use and getting a little better as cast iron always seems to do but that was always the great benefit with cast iron, it was cheap, easy to use and worked great all the time and this seems to have hiccups from old fashion cast iron I have always used. Hope this helps.",1673841817254,0,false

I pulled the last picture from the internet because I toss the rest. As shown in the 3rd picture I had to redo one anchor per side with the toggle bolt as shown in the 4th picture. It's an 1/4"" togfle bolt. If you buy this kit be prepared to go out to the hardware store to replace all anchors with at least 1/8"" toggle bolts so you can have adjustability. I only had 1/4"" on hand and could only thread them through the wider spot. Also be prepared to have an wood clamp nearby as this pipe is so thin that clamping it down in place with the included tiny 7mm mounting nut and bolt WILL turn it into an oval and don't expect the mounting tabs to stay in place. Talking about tabs I had to bend the tabs on each decorative cover to get them to catch properly to the mounts when I wasn't fighting with the now oval pipe ends.<br /><br />I would not purchase again and I suggest if you do get this set cheaply, use plastic curtain rings so you don't wear the cheap scratched out of the box chrome finish. Only plus I could say that earned the second star is that they gave you some extra rod mounting bolts and washers, that's it. I'm not bothering to take down because I have already put huge holes into the walls to get this mounted properly with toggle bolts.<br /><br />PS: This wouldn't fit down to 42 inches.

3,“Foaming at the mouth” (Reemix Milk Frother),"I used to sell coffee and this frother will make many happy with one important shortcoming.<br />PROS:<br />- extremely quiet (almost silent)<br />- suction cups hold it in place<br />- pretty quick (under 2 minutes at minimum level (3.5 oz)<br />- 4 options: all heated foam; hated milk/foam combination; heated milk; unheated frothed milk<br />- easy to clean with large mouth<br />- nice capacity (5 to 11.8 oz depending on use) while also compact (8” tall x 4” wide excluding handle)<br />CONS:<br />- very difficult to read min and max level marks inside the container<br />- other than for cappuccino, not for a single serve<br />- stops quickly at 60 to 65 degrees C in my tests; read on for why this matters<br /><br />The desired sweeter taste of milk occurs when the milk reaches 60 and 65 C, and as this frother shuts off so quickly on reaching 60 to 65 degrees C temperature none of my tests heating milk and foaming / frothing achieved the sweeter taste sought after, which is a key reason to prepare milk with a frother. Any of the other cons are acceptable to me, and would have resulted in a 5-star rating, but I can only rate this 3 stars due to the temperature / milk sweetness issue.

An incredibly huge problem is that this robot vacuum can’t get out of square or triangular spaces. It just keeps bouncing around. It legitimately cannot get out of the space between my office chair and the cabinet behind me.<br /><br />It’s as if the device is programmed to repeat the exact same turns every time the bumper runs into something, which causes it to get stuck in a loop just bouncing around the exact same touch points, when there’s plenty of room for it to get out if it would just stop going the exact same direction.<br /><br />Aside from the bumping being programmed terribly, the mapping doesn’t work well. It only traces from the charger, and if you pause from the app and move the device manually — it no longer maps. This also means that it won’t be able to find its way home if it’s moved manually at all. It will bump around until it finally sees the IR light from the dock.<br /><br />At the moment, I would not recommend buying this robot.

3,"Not impressed, poor value","So it works, but we were disappointed generally. We knew it wouldn’t look real, but still thought it would look better. And it seems like it wouldn’t take much with modern technology to improve on it. We have $10 Christmas candles that can be set for 4 types of flicker, etc., why shouldn’t something this expensive have at least that much. We knew from other comments the sound would be useless and it is. If you had a volume control you could probably set it low enough that the horrible quality would be tolerable, but you can’t so it blasts out like a building was on fire. From the research I did I think we could have done just as well with something cheaper and given the price jump from one size smaller it feels really overpriced. The unit we received was also a Houselux brand with the words Maserflame nowhere to be found so might be a little shady. Lastly, be warned the power cord sticks out the right side of the unit (if you are looking at the front) so as one of the pictures shows you need 37-37.2”, but we had 37.25” and the cord is extremely pinched. I don’t see how you could do it with less space.",1675045785290,2,true

Once you remove these things they might lay down for an hour or so before curling up again. It’s also so hard and thin and not comfortable to walk on at all. You can tell it continues to curl up because it was woven too tight as some of the corners are not symmetrical either. Love the pattern, but not even worth the small amount I paid for it. Returning is too much of a hassle so just going to junk this once I find another one that’s better quality. Don’t waste your time and check out Safavieh brand instead!! Amazing quality for price.",1673236071129,0,true

2,Not worth it would return if I could.,This just isn't doing it for me. Had almost six months. Great for a quick vacuum. But it just doesn't not clean well for how much it costs.

3,Weird greasy wrapping?!,I got the purple and black candles. I haven't received the black yet but took the purple out today. As mentioned in previous reviews the colors are great BUT they are smaller than the average taper. I just stuck some white tack in the bottom of the holder to get them to stick.  Mine also arrived packaged nicely with none broken or misshapen.<br /><br />For me the worst part is each candle is wrapped individually In plastic. Each sleeve of plastic felt greasy and was covered in a weird substance? Perhaps machinery grease or maybe the actually dye from the candles because I did notice it was on the candles as well. I'm not sure but they substance did appear to be purple or black on my hands... they also kind of smell like a factory or grease. So I don't know what that is about.<br /><br />I'm going to use mine mostly for decoration so I haven't lit them yet... if I do I will update this review.<br /><br />I'm honestly not too mad about the whole thing. They look nice at least and they were super cheap and as they say... you get what you pay for.,1673073657143,1,true

3,Display Only Not For Brewing Tea,"I bought this to be used to brew tea and serve to my guest. The Japanese design (though made in China) looks impressive. So much excitement while unboxing this product. The color is what I expected together with how the dragon is laid out around the teapot. The enameled cast-iron teapot has a very minimal plastic wrap around it. This causes some damage. Please see the photos I posted.<br /><br />The primary usage for this teapot is to showcase my selection of delicious tea while entertaining friends. The aesthetic is secondary. I was disappointed to see that the enamel coating was poorly done. The glaze is not smooth and the coating is thin. There are places where the enamels are chipped and scratched. Even the teapot cover has the enamel chipped. Please see the photos I posted.<br /><br />Cast iron teapots are glazed or enameled inside for two reasons. It prevents oxidation of the iron thus it serves as a rust-proofing and prevents tea acid from reacting with the iron. I washed, pour boiling water, and cleaned the inside. Brew and seep tea and the brewed tea has some metallic flavor with it. This is due to the bad enamel coating.  My tea seems came into contact with the metal beneath, which then react with the acidity of the tea and imparted a metallic flavor.<br /><br />This cast iron teapot will become a décor item and will not be used to brew tea due to the unpleasant taste it produces.<br /><br />If you wanted a kitchen or dining décor then you may buy this product. If you wanted to brew tea to entertain and serve to your friends - please do not think about buying this.",1678980851965,0,false
2,High Hopes Went Low,"I collect lunch boxes and when I saw this with simulated bamboo I need to have one. I have high hopes for this bento design. I got this lunch box today and was so excited to open it. Ohhh my high hopes went low.<br /><br />The bag needs to be washed to remove the chemical odor probably Formaldehyde. Even the elastic strap has that strong toxic odor and needs to be washed too.<br /><br />There are also rough edges around the top of the bento boxes. Please see the photos I posted.<br /><br />When I unstacked the two bento boxes and opened them. Surprised that they were not closed properly during manufacturing. Part of the silicone seal was crushed between the body and cover instead of just providing a seal.  Due to this, the silicone seal on both bento boxes was damaged. I will not be able to get a complete seal because of this.<br /><br />The design is nice and chic but due to poor manufacturing and non-existent quality control it's hard to recommend this lunch box.",1678911238731,0,false

3,Spice Rack With Missing Parts,"This magnetic spice rack is on the expensive side at $30.97 (as of Feb 28, 2023).  You may find a similar cheaper product.  What it may have that makes it more expensive is the inclusion of 8 clips. This is one of the reasons why I chose and purchased this.  I have 8 measuring spoons I need to clip on these holders for easy access.  However, I received only 6 clips and the set is missing 2 clips. I could not clip mount 2 of my measuring spoons because of this.  Please see the photos I posted.<br /><br />The back metal is not magnetic but instead has a flexible soft magnetic material glued on its back.  The metal corners are smooth to the touch and I did not find any rough or sharp areas that may cut my skin.<br /><br />There is a small gap you need to be aware of if you are planning to attach the same size side by side.  You need to put these on a flat metallic surface to prevent slipping off.  I experimented on a slight concave and it will lean on the heavier side and worst is it may fall.<br /><br />There are other inexpensive alternatives to this but if you are looking for an additional thing like a clip this is it, except you should only be aiming to use 6 clips since you may not receive 8.",1677591894767,0,false
3,Antique Flatwares With Rough and Sharp Edges,"If you are staring at these flatwares at a far you would say marvelous! I invested in a lot of real silver and stainless steel flatware but never owned a golden flatware set. Not until now. Having these at the dining table looks like I belong to a royal family.<br /><br />I like the gold shades of these utensils. They are subtle and more believable. The design is retro and more like one of that heirloom from a well-known brand. The handle ornaments are intricate and similar to my silver heirloom flatware. They feel solid and hefty. The dinner knives and spoons are large and quite heavy but comfortable to use.<br /><br />There are some rough edges on the fork tines and some are sharper compared to regular forks. Some spoons, knives, and forks have rough edges in several places. The curvatures were not sandblasted properly. These are more pronounced in bigger pieces like dinner knives and diner spoons, and unnoticeable on smaller pieces like teaspoons.<br /><br />All knives are unusable due to roughness. More than half of the spoons and forks are also unusable due to shard edges and roughness.<br /><br />These are good for display but at the dining table, you have to make sure you only use the ones without the rough edges. I will be uncomfortable serving these at the dining table.",1677364098722,0,false

The metal joints are loose and you need to tightened it up when you are done setting up the desired form.<br /><br />Overall, this is no-frills accessories.",1675374426552,0,false
1,Incorrect Product Information,"A 2-liter hotpot?  This would be perfect for my needs!<br /><br />But what a big disappointment when I received it. First of all. I inspected the product as soon as it arrived. I saw some deep scratches along the heating plate. Please see the photo of the one I took. The scratches, as per the seller are part of the design.  Hmmm.<br /><br />The hotpot material is not steel but aluminum coated with non-stick material.  The non-stick material is not ceramic but probably Teflon.<br /><br />This is not a 2 liter pot!  I washed the pot with warm soap and prepare it so I can boil 2 liters of water. I filled up 2 Nalgene bottles each with 1 liter of water for a total of 2 liters. The product description of 2L is incorrect. The pot has a MAX line that you should stay on so as not to overflow it. This is only a 1.5-liter pot. Please see the photo where there is a remaining 500 ml of water in the green bottle.<br /><br />I turned on the pot but another disappointment. Toxic fumes are coming out of the pot. When you do hotpot - you sit in front of it while boiling/blanching those small pieces of food.  You do not want to inhale those unhealthy fumes.<br /><br />I am not a happy camper.",1674751196794,1,false
1,Stay Away From This Kettle,"You will be astounded when you see the image and online description of this kettle.

Please see the photo I posted. It says it uses stainless steel but it is too thin. The outside is polished but the inside is not. It is dirty and you can see vertical scratches from manufacturing. There is also a deep scratch that it seems will start to corrode or rust. Did it say stainless steel?<br /><br />Poor manufacturing, substandard metal and poor quality control.

When you pinch the material - a 100% silicone product will not change color.  If the filler is used, then the color will change to whitish.<br /><br />Verdict - if you want this product to be used in baking, cooking and in your air-fryer - STAY AWAY FROM THIS PRODUCT!",1673369597165,0,false

Yes, I can wipe it off- but never had to do that with other salt and pepper shakers.<br /><br />Cute as they are- I have enough dishes to wash and not stoked to have an extra chore to wipe and clean the tops daily.",1677807054790,0,true

This cover does not stay on even with dowels pushed down between the arms and seat, and between the backs and seat.

One to keep the dog's nails from ripping the furniture and two because the furniture is ""pleather"" and is uncomfortable to sit on (it's either cold or hot).  The covers do not stay put.

3,There Are Better Robo Vacs Out There,"First of all I had a specific reason for buying this when it was on sale. I have a platform bed that has low clearance that I couldn't clean under. I went into this knowing that it wouldn't do a great job on my nylon looped medium pile carpet. However, to just get the top layer of dust bunnies under the bed would be a great improvement. I also needed something that wasn't a LiDAR vac, mapping, but a bump system. The remote also came in handy.<br /><br />I do think Eufy has the right idea in terms of maintenance allowing users to buy parts and you can buy battery replacements as well. We also have a Wyze robo vac with LiDAR that does a better job on carpets but fails to offer battery replacement options which is a concern everyone should consider when buying a robo vac. Luckily we have been able to buy both of these at discounted prices which made it a bit more palatable.<br /><br />So my advice is to assess what you truly need. Check to make sure any robo Vac your interested in has replacement parts especially batteries. Definitely wait for sales and of course read reviews from many different sources.<br /><br />This robo Vac still may be useful in some circumstances like mine, it's bumping sensing is very good, it will do floors adequately, but it's old tech compared to what is now available.",1677629339688,0,true

I figured he needed time to have shape restored, but alas, he is a little helpless. The concept is very cute, just very poorly executed. He will not hold items very well, unless stuffed to the max, so if you are planning on purchasing, I would definitely find a basket or bowl you can place inside firmly to make him more flat and firm.

Now at this point I got the frame without glass. As I stated before, it is a very nice frame, and rather big. Fully it's about the size of an 8x10 frame, just holds a 5x7. So it is a pretty good size. Truthfully had I not dealt with my mishap, I probably would have given this a five star. But unfortunately, they should have gone with plexiglass rather than actual glass when making this. Without the glass, it doesn't look the same. So I am not sure if I will even use this any more.

3,"Very flimsy control, battery dies waaaay too fast.","[[VIDEOID:e646ad5883fb478f22959f40e65b1039]] This battery powered vacuum comes with an array of accessories and is easy to charge and get going putting it to use. Having said all that, it is super flimsy when trying to control it, and using the floor attachment becomes irritating when it turns too hard, and you cannot straighten it with just a slight turn of your wrist and it not over correct. It also does not lock in an upward stance, so it tips very easy, unlike others. The suction also seems to be lacking when compared to others, even on the highest setting, and really does nothing for edges. You have to use the handheld extensions to get any deeper into corners, and it is sort of a must with this one, as it misses soooo much. The battery also dies extremely fast, and that's what my video was to show, sorry it went blurry.  Still, you can see it drops super fast in max mode, and for this to be useful, you really have to have it that high. Thus particular vacuum is best just being used as a handheld for corners or furniture, not flooring. Compared to other brands, this falls below their level, not by much, but still below. I own 3 now, and this falls in 3rd for sure out of all the brands. If you need a full use vacuum, this is not it, unless you do not mind having to do edges separately. If you need a decent handheld, this will be it. Overall, I will still use it, but probably hang it in my office for small tasks like vacuuming around small spaces.",1676982576698,1,false

The print came in a very large box, but snug along the frame. The print was cellophane/plastic wrapped to protect from scratches. As much as I'd love to give this 5 stars because I really love this canvas print, I just can't.<br />First, the measurements aren't exactly 20"" x 40"". In length, it's short about half an inch. In height, short about a quarter of an inch. This wasn't my main issue though.<br />My main issue is that the print has damages. Unlike one of the other buyer's purchase, my hooks were not taped to the back of the canvas. Instead, it appears the hooks were not included, so the seller tore the part of the plastic wrap and tucked the hooks under the frame. Why would you do that!? This damaged the print as shown in the photos. You can also see part of the frame that was chipped.<br />Even with the protective wrapping, some parts of the print were scratched and bent/creased. A couple examples shown in photos.<br />All in all, the print still looks great, but the quality control is what really knocked it down. The scratches and bends I would've let slide, but the way the hooks were handled could've been avoided if the person had just took care of this art and taped it like it should've been.

3,"VERY loud on warm setting, small capacity, frequent refill, hard to see remote","This humidifier is very loud during its warm setting making popping, gurgling, hissing and boiling water sounds. It is very inconsistent with these noises so it's very distracting and disturbing to light and sensitive sleepers. The Sleep setting only works with the cool mist option which is ridiculous. Part of the appeal of a warm mist is to warm the room in a cold environment at night. It shuts off if the water empties so there should be no issue with having Sleep mode for warm setting. The tank is small so if you have the highest steam move (three lines) on, it will not last through the night. You will be refilling it at least every day if you need high humidity. You will need the room to be closed and not too big in size if you want the humidity level to stay over 55%. The problem with humidity measurements on these devices is that they only measure the humidity levels closest to the unit, not the levels at the furthest point so they are highly inaccurate. If you are asleep at the furthest point and the unit is across the room, it will shut of when the humidity reaches settings near it and not where you are. The REMOTE buttons are VERY difficult to see in low light so you don't know what button you're pushing. The unit itself is OKAY if you can tolerate these things. It does do a decent job on the cool setting and on the medium moisture flow.  Mainly, the most annoying part of this unit is that it's inconsistently loud and obnoxious on the warm setting and needs to be refilled very frequently. I keep an item in front of it to block out the brightness of the numbers at night because I can't put it on Sleep mode in the Warm setting. I believe I will be returning this unit.",1674510849734,4,true
2,Can't get beyond 45% humidity in a closed 10x12 room,"I had high hopes for this humidifier,  however, after using it for over a week, it has not been able to reach 45% or higher humidity level in a closed 10x12 room located in the midwest.  It is absolutely COVERED in white powder residue. It makes gurgling noises when on warm mode.  The good: it is quiet otherwise, easy to fill, lightweight, easy to control, has sleep mode BUT sleep mode will only run COOL and WILL NOT run WARM.  Two 360 degree nozzles spin the mist around but doesn't seem to have enough power or force to humidify an entire room equally.  I'm returning this product with disappointment.",1673289824851,0,true
2,So disappointed,"We had a knockoff iRobot that finally died.  I did a lot of research and thought this would be a perfect upgrade.  I was so wrong.  First of all, it doesn't fit under my couch!  How crazy is that?!  And I do not have an abnormally low couch, just an average newish couch.  Secondly, I thought it would empty into a canister that would then need to be emptied into the trash.  And being that the cannister is so large, I figured I'd only have to empty it monthly, or biweekly, or even weekly would be fine, but that is not the case.  It empties into the tiniest little bag inside the canister.  If you have dogs who shed, this bag fills up and needs to be replaced after one household sweep.  It's not cost effective nor is it environmentally conscious.  It's unbelievably actually.  My last complaint is the noise.  It's so loud, I fear that it could cause hearing damage with prolonged use.  I definitely cannot recommend this vacuum.",1674795387857,0,false

3,Inconsistent manufacturing / color quality,"I bought these lights to string along the inside of my backyard fence.  They seem well built, installation was straightforward, they put out enough light to gently illuminate my entire yard during the dark winter months, and they’ve performed well in the inclement weather here in alaska.  In fact, i liked the lighting effect so much that I decided to complete the full perimeter by extending the runs (coupling two strings together).<br /><br />This is where the problems began.  I ordered precisely the same item (buy it again button), but received a decidedly “yellower” string (label clearly stated 6500k white).  Thinking perhaps this was a one-off, i requested a replacement from Amazon.  Same issue, the replacement was new a yellowish-tinge that matched neither the original color NOR the yellowish lights they were intended to replace.<br /><br />I contacted the manufacturer directly, and received the following response: “I'm very sorry for this situation. It may be caused by Amazon's logistics distribution error. Thank you for telling us the question. We will contact Amazon as soon as possible and solve it. If you have any other questions later, you can contact us at any time.”<br /><br />Uhhhh… what?  How does citing an amazon distribution error explain SUNRIE’s inconsistent product?!  The lights are labeled the same, but seem to be a different color with each iteration.  To follow up, i have heard exactly nothing from the seller since.<br /><br />So, if you’re going to order these and want more than one string, beware the inconsistency in coloring.  You’re on your own trying to get two matched sets!",1675496483711,0,true

YES IT IS!  When you turn on controller, bright blue light cones on.  After that- nothing. It always resets to low so I have to increase the heat every night.  In the middle of the night, if I want to change setting, I can’t feel which button is which- plus no light is on.<br /><br />I have put plastic sticky dots on the buttons I use so I can turn it off or down at night without using a flashlight to see the thing.

The pillow itself also has a weird smell, but i fluffed it up then threw the whole pillow (minus the cover) into the dryer for 25 minutes.

The handle is a much better design on the 24oz (it flips down instead of being a molded plastic that sticks out) so I was very happy.  Until I realized the re-design on the straw was horrible.  Basically every time I close the straw down it pushes the straw down inside the water bottle providing for a terrible suction.  So you have to open the lid and push the straw back up into place.

Because it could be something else I'm giving this 3 stars until I can confirm and will update my findings later.",1674599017133,0,false
3,"Not as great as I had hoped, but it works","This seemed like a great way to organize our kitchen wrapping tubes.  We like how it looks.  Functionally, though, there are some issues that make it not as usable for us as we hoped it would be.<br /><br />PROS:<br />- Looks elegant, modern, clean<br />- Comes with a nice set of clear labels and mounting screws<br />- Nice to have several different materials nicely stored in the one box<br /><br />CONS:<br />- Magnets holding the side door closed are too small and aren't very strong so the cover can easily get knocked out/off.<br />- You can only access the interior from the side.  So cleaning the interior may be a bit of challenge.<br />- Ours had a break in the wood surface and one of the dividers was not seated well.  Fixable with some glue, but nicer if it hasn't come this way.<br />- No sticky tape or something to keep the materials from retreating back into the box.  They made an accommodation for this with some finger holes so at least you can get your fingers in to try and fish out the material.  Still can be a pain as I find more often than not the rolls pull back into the box.  I guess you could put a strip of double-sided sticky tape next to each cutting rail and that would be enough, although a raised metal slot you could feed the material through would be better as it would serve a dual purpose of holding the material from disappearing back into the box and also keep it down while you cut.<br />- The cutters cut decently if you hold the material taut against the cutter rail.  But the cutter handle doesn't go far enough to the sides so I find I have to jiggle around with it sometimes to position the cutter ahead of the material to cut.<br />- We were hoping to get this into a drawer.  I believe we have a standard height drawer at around 3.25"" clearance.  This just doesn't make it.  The rails barely make it, and the added cutter height makes it just too tall to fit.  We'll have to find a place to mount it on the wall.  For now we stand it on its side in the pantry but often when we go to take it out the side panel falls off because of the aforementioned magnet issue.<br /><br />Again, this is a nice looking storage box and it does the job.  I just can't wholeheartedly recommend it for the reasons above.",1672776354330,0,false

3,Emitting strong chemical smell,"This is an unusual review. The item looks good. Fit perfectly in a small corner in an alcove in my house. It was relatively easy to assemble. While assembling, a strong chemical smell was in the air from the parts. I though little of it as many new items have strong smells from the paint and or glue. The smell seemed unusual though. I place the piece in it's position and went to bed. My eyes were iching badly. I could smell the odor through the closed door. It was worse in the morning and my eyes were swollen. My child eyes started running. I had to put the item outside. I decided to write a review because I want this item recalled if this is a common problem.

There were a few holes missing that I had to drill in myself.<br />The bottoms of the drawers are cardboard.

2,Does NOT prevent ice melting/not spill proof,"I had high hopes for this item and chose it over the Yeti brand. I am here to attest:<br />#1 this item does NOT keep your cold beverage's ice from melting up to the 24 hour mark. I have only managed to keep cubed and crushed ice solid for around 4-5 hours. This makes for a very lousy and watered down beverage. (I did have luck maintaining the ice solid when the outside temperature was below 45° and I had limited access to a warm environment.)<br />#2 The double lid option was a nice selling point. However, regardless of the lid I've chosen or of the options I've tried to use of the various functions of both lids has resulted in the same disappointing results as #1, #3, and #5 within my listed reviews.<br />#3 I'm a HUGE fan of having the ability to utilize the straw option. Neither lid has a simple straw hole. Using the straw option has been the only option to keeping my ice from melting within 4-5 hours. All other usable lid methods results in the ice melting between 2-3 hours. The straw is easily cleanable with the included straw insertable washing scrubber.<br />#4 This size barely holds one can of soda without adding ice. If you add ice, plan on immediately drinking about 1/4th of the beverage before you're able to put either choice of lid on the tumbler.<br />#5 This tumbler isn't even close to being spill proof or even spill resistant. Regardless of which of the two lids you choose to place on the tumbler to secure your beverage, even with the lid's closed features, a simple tipping motion to take a small sip or take a full gulp results in your beverage, at the very least leaking down your chin, and at the worst your beverage ending up on your shirt.<br />#6 I chose to wait to review this product to give it an honest opportunity to live up to its description and other higher reviews. I'm completely disappointed. I'd return the item and request my money back, but making the trip to return the item would be more expensive just using my gas and time.<br />#7 The 1st reason I did not give this item a 1 star is because of the removable handle. Acces to an adjustable/removable handle was a huge selling point for me. The handle has the ability to fit on more than one other reliable tumblers not having a handle option. I was able to slide the handle on a leak proof Yeti brand straw hole lid option tumbler from a huge gas/convenient store called<br />Buc-ee's and a tumbler without a handle or straw hole option at Walmart and still use a straw. With this said, I recommend staying off all online platforms when looking for a reliable tumbler and finding one in person, regardless of brand.<br />#8 The second reason I refrained from giving this item a 1 star is that its base actually fits into a standard sized vehicle cup holder.<br />*There will be no review updates on the quality of this tumbler. The only potential review change will come if the company were to reimburse me withOUT requiring me to use my gas or time to travel to a location to return the item.",1678291545902,0,true

I’ve purchased salt and pepper shakers in the past, and the stoppers were either clear or had a frosted look to them. They were softer and easy to remove and replace. These were terrible stoppers. They yellowed due to how old they must’ve been and became hard and brittle. I couldn’t even remove them as they were almost stuck inside the hole. On both, they cracked and broke along the lip area. I had to maneuver them out with the dull end of a butter knife. When the salt and pepper run out, I’m not sure we will be able to refill them, as there’s no way these old stoppers can withstand trying to remove them again.

2,Aesthetically Pleasing but Not Long Term Comfortable,"The title says it all. This chair functions more visually than it does comfort-wise. It’s very cute and I love the gray color. The pleated back design really elevates the look of the chair. The seat is also nice and wide. However, it basically feels like you’re sitting on an unpadded base. I’m not sure if it’s just my chair - but I also feel like I’m leaning forward even though I’m not. I think it might just be the lack of good structural foam in the butt pad. For the price, I’m not surprised the chair isn’t the most comfortable. If you’re spending maybe an hour or two in an office - this would probably do the trick… if you need a comfortable study spot or work from home option… pass on this.

3,"3.5 Stars due to inaccurate sewn size, 6"" wider than it is suppose to be.","These sheets have a beautiful sheen to them and are so very soft, it feels like silk feel.  The thread count is so tight making these sheets look and feel like luxury sheets but at a price that is totally reasonable.  I ordered the Golden color in King size.  I wouldn't call the color golden, it is more like a cream color, very pretty.<br /><br />As for the king size, I don't think the person making mine measured accurately.  The fitted sheet is suppose to be able to fit on a 16"" deep mattress and would fit that thickness for sure, however the measurements across are way bigger than my King size bed.  The corner seams go well passed the top edge of my bed, by more than 6"".  I had to just tuck the excess width of the sheet under my mattress, which then hid the corner seam on the one side.  I thought at first that I had it on wrong so I gave it a quarter turn, but then it was really long over the foot of the bed.  The measurements head to foot vs the side to side on the fitted sheet are only suppose to be about a 2"" difference but mine is at least 6"" wider.  The head to foot measurements are spot on.<br /><br />I shall give them several nights use and see if this presents a problem with the fitted sheet coming untucked and coming off of the mattress.  I will update in a week to let you know if this becomes an issue and update this review if needed.<br /><br />I had some difficulty with the correct star rating for this item because although it is pretty, soft, organic, and made of a renewable resource, I feel that it should have been a nice snug fit on the mattress and this was off by more than an acceptable amount and only in one direction.  I finally decided that I would give it a 3.5 stars for now and adjust up or down by .5 stars once I have had a good chance to test the sheet out in real life to see if it will stay put with this flaw.",1672716624517,0,false

The floral arrangement inside is kind of dull even in good lighting, the wing tips and edges are in the sharper side, the gold appears painted on and the mirrored base doesn't sit flush to the glass and makes it feel tacky and cheap.

2,WTF is going on with this listing??,"I wish I had read the reviews before I bought this spoon because the inconsistencies mentioned in the reviews say it all.<br />The idea of a “cereal killer” spoon is awesome! I can think of so many people in my life that would love this spoon, but I’m not going to be buying another one and I’m probably going to return the one I did get.<br />So the idea of this spoon is great. The skull and crossbones design is cute and the font is perfect for it. But that’s where the things I like about this spoon end.<br />Here are the problems I have with it:<br />Size of the spoon and length of the handle:<br />Anyone who loves cereal will tell you that they need the biggest spoon possible to eat their cereal with! If a spoon says “cereal killer“ on it you think of a big spoon, not a little spoon with a really long handle like the one I received. That kind of spoon is called an iced tea spoon. It’s not a cereal spoon.  Not even for someone who isn’t a cereal lover per se. The spoon I received is literally an iced tea spoon which means that the actual spoon is smaller than a teaspoon and the handle is almost twice as long as it should be. It isn’t a good size to eat anything with, let alone cereal. The spoon is worthless really.<br />The inconsistencies across the spoons customers receive:<br />When I looked at the reviews and the pictures of the spoons that customers have received it looks like there are many different variations of the spoon. The spoon I received was an iced tea spoon, some customers received a spoon that looks like it’s made for a child, some customers received a regular teaspoon, etc. But not one customer in the reviews I read received a spoon that it is worthy of saying “cereal killer” on it! Clearly, there isn’t anyone who works for the company that makes these spoons who’s a true cereal lover!<br />The “engraving”:<br />The lettering is not engraved into the spoon, it’s lasered onto the metal. Actual engraving is etched into the metal, while this is printed onto the metal. Based on my past experiences with this kind of “engraving” it fades over time and eventually rubs off entirely.<br />The visibility of the lettering:<br />The lettering on the spoon I received is hard to see unless you hold it in the light just right. Part of that is because the metal is so shiny, which is nice, but you should be able to see the lettering without having to look for it. If the lettering was actually engraved, this wouldn’t be a problem, but because it’s lasered onto the metal, it’s hard to see. The tiny size of the actual spoon doesn’t help!<br />The presentation:<br />The spoon I received was in a long, flat box, the kind that a necklace might come in, plain navy blue, with a velvet lining, and the spoon was presented very nicely in the box. I didn’t have any problem with the presentation of the one I received. But after reading a bunch of other reviews, and looking at some of the photos in the reviews, it’s clear that the presentation of this spoon is very inconsistent from order to order. Some customers got the spoon in a plastic bag that was sealed, some got it in a plastic bag that was not sealed, some got it in a box like the one I got mine in, some got it in a box with a floral print on it, etc. There were many different variations of the presentation of the spoon in the reviews. If Amazon can’t be consistent with the presentation of their items, they shouldn’t state what the presentation of the item will be or show images of it in its listing. Instead of saying that it comes in “elegant packaging“ the listing should just not say anything at all about the packaging.<br />I think that covers everything that disappointed me about this spoon! Needless to say, I wouldn’t recommend buying this spoon for the purpose it’s intended for—You’ll only be disappointed. I’m going to search the small business website that starts with “E” to find a better one for my “cereal killer” husband!",1676487903089,2,true

3,Blackout - good. Thermal - not so much,"They work well in their ""blackout"" function and they look fine, but the main reason I ordered this was the ""Thermal Insulated"" feature. I had a room that got chilly on a cold day. You could feel it especially by one window. I was hoping these curtains would help. Hours after I put them up, I noticed that the room was still chilly. I used a temperature gun to measure the difference between the room side of the curtains and the window behind the curtains. There was only a degree or two of difference.<br /><br />I wound up getting a window kit to cover the window in plastic. That quickly did a much better job at keeping the chill out of the room.",1673917815603,0,true
3,Thin Cotton Material,"There’s really nothing exceptional about these pillow covers from Sealy.  They are meant to be just pillow covers to extend the longevity of pillows.  It’s not touting hypoallergenic properties.  I suppose you can extrapolate to that, because the material is 100% cotton.  Speaking of material, it is only 200 thread count.  It is soft but thin.  There’s no smell or piling after washing.  The zipper does not look like the picture.  It is not a hidden zipper.  I washed it in cool water and tumble low setting.  It shrunk from 35” X 19.5” to 33.5” X 19”.  It does fit in my King sized Sealy pillows, (decade old) ,but I had to really work hard to make them fit.<br /><br />Why did I give it 3 stars?<br />1) There was loose stitching around the zipper closure. (See photo)<br />2) Due to the low thread count, they may not last a long time after frequent washes.<br />3) Shrinkage factor (unless they are making King sized pillows smaller these days)<br />I wasn’t particularly impressed with the overall construction.",1677772787346,0,false
2,Bath Mat Won’t Stay Suctioned,"I thought this would be a good idea to place on the bottom of our shower/tub stall to prevent slippery falls.  Also, the “Microban-Protection” was an added bonus.  Unfortunately,  I found that the suction cups just will not stay suctioned to the tub floor.  The tub is not textured, and I wet the surface as instructed.  The label states “Not for use on textured surfaces”.  I had to practically stomp on it to get it to stay suctioned.  But after showering, the mat is back to being 1/3 suctioned .  Not sure what I am doing wrong.<br /><br />The mat is thick with large holes for good drainage.  It isn’t slippery at all.  The label also recommends hanging it to dry after each use.  So, each time I have to try to get it stay put on the tub surface.  Too time consuming.  It has been used for a week and a half now, and I still have a problem with the suctioning power.  This bath mat isn’t a mat I would recommend.",1677254892616,0,false
3,Slight Odor in the Bags,"I am not as impressed with this PAMI brand of gallon storage bags as I was with their quart-sized double lock bags.  There are 100 bags but NO twist ties were included with my order even though it states it on the box.  I have a ton of extra twist ties, so I moved on.  The bag is wider and shorter than my store bought ones.  So, it probably is still gallon sized.  I do like that the top is slightly uneven for easy opening.  I also like that there’s multiple suffocation warning prints on the front.<br /><br />Why did I give it 3 stars?  When I opened one to place prepared vegetables, I noticed a slight odor.  It’s not unpleasant or plasticky.  My store bought ones don’t have an odor.  Even though the bags are BPA-free, I decided to use it for storing non-food items, just to be safe.  For storing craft items, they are quite useful.  Each bag is about 8 cents, so twice as much as generic store-bought ones.  I would give it a resounding five stars, if it weren’t for the odor.",1676739177706,0,false
3,Wooden Utensils Not All Perfect,"These acacia wooden utensils are sturdier than the bamboo ones I have been using, but this set has some imperfections.  One of the spatulas has an uneven sheen to it (see middle photo).  I think the utensils were treated with something to make them waterproof.  When I washed them, water just beads on the surface.  By the way, Hand-Washing is recommended.  The other imperfection is that two of the utensils have asymmetric holes on the handles.(see photo).<br /><br />On the positive side, the spatulas were ergonomically comfortable to use and the longer spatula is 13.5” long- even longer than the standard bamboo utensils. (It’s not 8.3” as it is shown in the product photo description). That is useful for larger pots or pans.  It is easy to stir fry food around the pan.<br />In conclusion, these utensils are great as sturdy utensils that won’t fray on the edges like bamboo ones.  However, not as a gift set due to the imperfections.  Hence, the overall 3 star rating.",1675094528382,0,false
2,Handle Not Ergonomic,"I anticipated that these glasses were going to be slightly heavier than borosilicate glasses, but not this heavy.  To compound the heaviness, it’s very hard to grip the handle.  The handle of the glass has a raised ridge down the middle (see photo), which is a bit annoying every time I pick up the glass.  I have to hold it like it’s a beer stein.  Also, the handle has a rounded contour, which makes it harder to grip.  Each glass weighs 12.5 ounces, according to my scale— that’s like carrying almost a pound!  I wouldn’t recommend these glasses for those with arthritic hands.  A few times, it almost slipped from my hand while carrying it.<br /><br />There are some positives.  It went through my dishwasher top rack fine, and for some reason, the glass doesn’t leave hard water stain marks.  It holds 12 ounces.  It has a 3” diameter.  The description photo shows 4.5”, and that is not correct.  It’s 4.5” from handle to perimeter of glass.<br /><br />I think some modifications needs to be done on the design.",1674925486483,0,false

3,Perfect for the person who has nothing to put in it.,"This is colorful, and a small cheerful accent piece for many places around the house. However I wouldn’t use it to hold any sort of foodstuff, even crackers or cookies, as crumbs are likely to work their way into the seams. And this is a difficult item to clean — at best you can wipe it out with a damp cloth. No dunking in the sink or running it through the dishwasher.<br />So what can you put in it then? In the kitchen maybe matchbooks, birthday candles, twist ties or a roll of twine. In the bathroom maybe cotton balls, q-tips, flossers and oh, yeah, matchbooks.<br />Basically this is a piece you buy for its aesthetics and not its utility. And I’d feel better about the former if it didn’t have a pronounced seam running down one side. Ultimately it is what it is, and I can’t say I’d buy it again.  But if it’s exactly the accent piece you’ve been looking for who says you have to put anything in it at all!",1673411958774,1,true

2,Consistency is lacking,"I had two sets on my wishlist and my husband got me one set, not realizing it was only a service for 4. They were GORGEOUS! I was so happy with them. There were a couple with small imperfections but nothing I couldn’t live with. They were packed extremely well and the color is just stunning!<br />Once he realized we needed a second set he ordered another. This set was also packed extremely well, but that’s where the similarities ended. The new ones are much, much lighter and quite a few are a bit wonky in the glazing. There are pits, tiny bubbles, and even a spot or two where it looks like the glaze didn’t even make it onto the dish. I contacted the manufacturer through their website at the end of January, as stated to do going through Amazon, and I have yet to hear back from them (it’s now Feb 10th).<br />I’ve added pictures to show the first set (“Set 1”) and what came in the second box (“Set 2). I’m hoping to hear back from the seller soon since I only have enough for 4 settings and the other box is half unpacked and sitting in the middle of my dining room waiting to see what I need to do with them (re-pack them all, etc). I will update my review once I, hopefully, hear back and get some resolution (in the form of getting a matching set of the color and quality that was in our first order).",1676085758276,0,false

They give you a screwdriver but it’s basically useless for the wood screws involved, you’ll need a power driver to get them to thread in without stripping. Instructions were easy enough to follow and the pieces were all labeled or pictured well. It’s not too complicated.<br /><br />The lights are a total gimmick that they might as well not include. They’re just two sticky battery LEDs, and I’ll save them for something else. I don’t need to change batteries on my furniture! I didn’t buy it for the light, though.",1678134373606,0,true

3,Neoprene sleeve is great; Interior rack is problematic,"I was gifted a sous vide, which was something I had wanted to try for some time.  I chose this container because it looked like a good trade off of cost, quality and features.  I especially like the sleeve, which helps retain heat.  The acrylic material so far has held up well, and the size was enough to cook 4-5 NY strip steaks at one time, although I feel like even though it's 12Qt, it could stand to be a little bit bigger.<br /><br />The biggest problem is that the metal shelf that is meant to keep the food items submerged in the water uses tiny little screws to hold it into the acrylic lid.  It came unassembled, and there is no good access to the screws, which is the first problem.<br /><br />The second problem is that the screw holes in the PA lid are so small and the threads are so fine, they strip out incredibly easily, and once they pop loose, I was unable to find a way to keep them on, even with Gorilla Glue or other products.  I feel like this is something that simply requires a different engineering approach, using a means of attaching the shelf that is more permanent and less likely to fail so quickly (one of the screws popped loose the first time I used it).  Perhaps if there was a metal bracket already attached more securely to the lid, or the whole assembly could be permanently attached.<br /><br />Given the problems with this lid shelf, I expect that the clock is running on the time before I will just have to discard the shelf altogether, or else find a different container system.",1673986773873,0,true

2,Not A Good Investment!,"I bought mine local for around 75 dollars + tax.

I had shelves built like this in Las Vegas many years ago when I lived there that were awesome no need for anchoring & they fit like they should so I figured this one I bought would be the same but I was wrong!<br /><br />Cons,<br /><br />- Sags / Not Snug<br />- Has Holes in Shelves (Not good if your setting anything that will fall threw on it)<br />- Shelves are made cheap<br />- Not good for use for computers, servers, etc (or anything you value)<br />- The price for something made so cheap...<br /><br />Pros,<br /><br />- I know not to buy another one!<br />- Next time I will make my own or buy something I can see setup local<br /><br />Sadly this wasn't setup on display so I had no way of knowing what I was getting. I could have taken it back had it started to sag in the middle of the shelves when I bought it, but its to late now.<br /><br />If you are going to buy something like this make sure you have a working display present so you know what your getting & don't loose money in the process.

Three small holes in total. They are not a big deal now, but I feel that the plastic tags were totally unnecessary in the first place (as already mentioned, there was the Velcro wrapper as well as the entire thing was encase in plastic).

3,Felt sort of stifled by it,"My son is the neck pillow king in our house and I got this with him in mind. He has a rather dreadful one that can't be properly washed and I am more than ready to retire it. When I showed him this model, with the removable cover (washable!) and sleek design, he was excited. He immediately took off his old one (he walks around the house with it, reads/studies with it AND uses it in the car to sleep when a passenger on a long trip). He liked this new one at first, then his face got an odd look on it. He tugged at it, spun it around, and took it off. He declared that it was really nice and had a lot of good things to it, but he simply doesn't like the closure. He prefers the traditional opening in front.<br /><br />A few days later I, a neck pillow newbie, tried it. I immediately felt sort of stifled by it. And lest you wonder, it is not because I am large. To the contrary. I felt like I was wearing a very uncomfortable turtleneck. I took it off pretty quickly.<br /><br />I think maybe we are just the wrong people for this product. It is attractive, washable...has a lot of great plusses.

The construction is not well described, the screws are oriented to show in the front with no caps to hide them, the clothes bin slide is sticky  and difficult to easily pull in and push back, and it just feels rickety.  The ONE thing I like about it is the side shelving, very useful in a small studio apartment bathroom.  But the rest is a disappointment.

I actually bought 2 sets, as I bought it to replace, literally, dollar store plates that I bought over 10 years ago. The quality of the dollar store plates is without a doubt, BETTER. The glazing is inconsistent, there are little bubbles where the glaze didn't take and where the paint underneath is uneven and it has little catches so it isn't smooth. The biggest issue I have is that the bases are uneven, so they don't set atop each other with regularity. They are crooked, leaning from one side to the other and look very cheap when they are stacked up in such a way. I know that 75$ isn't a ton for a set of 4 dinnerware. However, being that my dollar store plates and bowls are all identical and even, it was rather surprising that these were of such inconsistent quality. You can find better for the price. Unless this was exactly the design/style you were looking for (as in my case) and you have to look past these rather significant flaws given it is every other piece that has them, I would look elsewhere...like the dollar store.

Also, the flavor was so LIGHT. After 2 days of brewing, the coffee looks watered down. I used a Columbian Roast, so it should have been a little darker than that.

I think it is a potentially worthwhile product, but once I put it in my cupboard and organized my cans, it wouldn't hold nearly as much as my cupboard would hold without it.  So it didn't save any space in my cupboard, it only wasted space for my storage.  Of course, the first in first out feature is nice, but if you want to have the same product in a FIFO line, you can't mix different kinds of cans of products.  For example, I wanted canned soup, but to use all the space I had to mix the flavors of the soup.  Instead of using it in my everyday storage, I will try to find a place in my long-term storage.

I didn't think anything of it until I got home from work and took the bottle out of my work bag. There were 3 substantial scratches on different areas of the bottle. The only thing I van think of is maybe my spiral notebook scratched it? There was nothing else in there. Needless to say, it scratches way too easily and after day 1 my bottle looked like it had been through a war!<br />2) I'm not totally sure what the carbon filter does or if it has to ever be replaced after a while, but when my bottle was empty the filter is heavier than the straw so it banged against the inside metal walls which made a very annoying clanging sound. There is know way to take the large black filter off the straw!<br /><br />To me those are 2 substantial cons!

I've been looking for something to fit that space for years and was so happy this would fit.<br /><br />The entire unit is made of thin, flexible plastic sheets and hard wires with plastic connector pieces. I wish it was sturdier and the pieces more uniform as the way the pieces connect make it a bit crooked. Some doors stay closed and some do not.<br /><br />It comes with very tiny zip ties and terrible sticky tape to connect it to the wall. I had to use different zip ties and even though I cleaned the walls, the double sided tape pieces became unstuck overnight.",1675118049499,2,true

2,"Looks like the picture, but not functional","Had a version of this from 5-6 years ago, would give that one ****. The newer one is different, and basically useless as a plunger. Brush works, but expensive to just get a brush.<br /><br />Minor change is the caddy is now very cheap/thin lightweight plastic, used to be much heavier, and thus more stable, but that isn't a huge deal.<br /><br />The main problem is the plunger just doesn't work.<br /><br />It plunges down fine, but then sticks in the inverted shape and takes 5-10 seconds of no pressure to pop back out to the starting form. This means you can only push down the drain, not push-pull-push-pull.<br /><br />Ordered 3 of these, and they all do it, so it's not a random defect - it's a design flaw.<br /><br />Will need to order a different plunger.",1674235597010,0,true

2,Nice but prepare for lower quality.,These are nice but the quality is a little disappointing.

It wasn't the most comfortable sitting on. It might be better after a few months when you break the chair in but right off the bat it was a bit stiff.<br />The lumbar wasn't bad, but the way I sit, it felt like it was pushing my back forward a little too much even with it push as far back into the chair as possible.<br />Overall it was an ok chair, but I didn't like it.

3,"Don't trust its leak-proofing, otherwise good","It retains heat for a reasonable amount of time, and when it's brand new it even seals up pretty well - definitely not well enough to toss into a bag, ever, but won't splash coffee all over your car.<br /><br />Fast forward a couple of uses, and that slidy thing that covers the drinking opening gets completely loose and the vibrations of your car while driving cause it to slide open little by little until you hit a bump and have coffee on your console.<br /><br />If you just want something for your desk to prevent an absolute flood when you knock it over, this will do the trick - though you can get far better cups for that purpose. It's pretty useless for anything else if you expect it to not leak.  If that's not an issue though, it's fine otherwise.<br /><br />Speaking of knocking over, it wouldn't knock over so easily if the bas wasn't so narrow so... IDK. Definitely wouldn't buy this design again.",1678052094358,0,true

3,Not worth the $,"This thing isn’t terrible. I like having the top surface, but the whole thing feels cheap and flimsy. After using it for a little over three months we are annoyed with it. The baskets pull out crooked bc the structure is so flimsy and the whole thing shifts too much for there to be any fluid motion. It’s also really hard to roll over anything except the flattest surfaces. If you’re going to keep it in a laundry room it’s probably ok, but we go from our bedroom to the laundry room and I’m not sure I give it a year before the whole thing falls apart. If it was $40 this would be a whole different review. My problem with it is how over priced it is for something so flimsy.",1676262943700,0,true

When the weight is offset, the plastic section pops out. Unable to secure it. There is a divider provided (which is awesome). It is slightly too small, and often falls out when removing brushes.

These are currently listed for nearly $25, and at that price, I expect a higher quality paint job.

3,Handle broke off with straining rice,Overall I thought these were very good.  Choices in size good for different needs.  Note: the mesh strain warps but does not effect straining.  Though BIG note: handles are weak at attachment point.  After reasonable use since I purchased (2 yrs ago) the handles on the largest broke off at welding point when rinsing rice.  Considering the break and the warping not worthy of 5 stars.  Expect about 2 yrs of use IMO.,1673007146758,2,true

They enjoy it.<br />It's handy for onions if you make sure all the skin is off.<br />It doesn't work on sweet potatoes, even cut into smaller pieces. Sweet potatoes are too dense.<br />It doesn't work on peppers. Peppers. The dish is too shallow and peppers too tall, so it just sort of sits there while you bang on the butt. Yes, that's unfortunate phrasing. This is an unfortunate apparatus.<br />This is not a dicer, so get diced/cubes of veggies out of your head. This is a slicer.

2,Rickety & Petite,"This is a handsome little bookshelf (emphasis on little) but the build quality seems light for the price. It is somewhat unsteady, despite all the screws being tightened well. I'm not concerned that it will collapse in the near term but I worry that the extra wobble will someday result in the screw holes wearing out and causing structural problems. It's also somewhat smaller than I anticipated based on the photos, but it does match the measurements on the listing.<br /><br />Additionally, for anyone who is ordering, be aware that some of the construction pieces are mislabeled (for instance, in my box, there were two sizes of wooden pegs, the number labels for which were transposed. Other than this, it was pretty straightforward to construct and with an electric drill/screwdriver it was a breeze.<br /><br />Even though I don't think it's a good value because of it being so rickety, it would be a pain in the neck to disassemble it to return it so I probably won't bother, but I would be cautious about buying it if you're thinking of putting anything fragile or heavy on it. Then again a bunch of the other reviews said it was great, so your mileage may vary.",1679176227339,0,true
3,"No volume control, too loud for migraineur","I was hoping there would be an option to adjust the alarm volume, I am easily prone to migraines and it reaches a high frequency pitch and very loud volume that are physically painful and a risk to cause a migraine, especially on a bad morning if I'm dealing with other migraine triggers. Not everyone's ""loudest"" volume is the same, and I would like a product to trust its customers to see to their own needs--I'm buying it because I want it to annoy me, so if I had set the volume too low and it didn't wake me, that would be on me. However, I'm buying it to annoy me, not to hurt me.<br /><br />Also, the snooze button didn't really work, i stabbed it as hard as possible and it just kept screaming so I had to use the alarm on/off button. I may have just gotten a defective unit though.<br /><br />The written instructions could do with a bit better labeling on the diagram, for instance the button which is physically marked on the device with an ""A"" is helpfully labeled on the instructions as just... ""A"". It would make setup faster if it labeled it as ""alarm"", similarly for the ""T"", ""H"", ""M"", and most importantly it would have been helpful to have the image icon buttons labeled with what they are. The little tiny embossed bell icon and the circle icon are not immediately intuitive as to what they are, but they're referred to by name in the written instructions as the ""alarm"" button and the ""wheels"" button. Not life-breakingly difficult, but if the manufacturer wants to optimize their instruction manual, these are my suggestions.<br /><br />If you have vision problems, the button letters/icons are very tiny and are simply embossed, they are not marked in ink, so that may or may not be a dealbreaker for you.<br /><br />Ideally it would be helpful if the backlight could be tapped to light up, I think tapping the snooze button may do that though. As with all modern electronics, the LED backlight is a bright blue, so it's good for waking you up but not great if you just want to check the time during the night--again, maybe not a dealbreaker for you. I know it would increase the cost of production to add an RGB adjustment function, that would be cool to have though. I am very pleased that the display numbers themselves are just LCD with a backlight rather than always-on LED numbers, that's not common to find and is a preference for me.<br /><br />The battery compartment lid is very fiddly and it makes it annoying to change the batteries, it would be much easier to use if it had a click-in-place latch that you can then screw closed rather than just a screw closure.<br /><br />The wheels have a rubberized coating, and it does indeed zoom around chaotically very well. It's well weighted to right itself and keep the display upright.",1678822777337,1,true
3,Warm in Space,"This is really well made, and super soft and plush. Its a nice size, and the hood is extra comfy with the way it unfolds and zips. The fact that it folds into a nice sized pillow helmet s fantastic.<br />However, the way or what the seams are stitched with is a painful problem. It's like a fishing line type of thread, and it rubs along with being sharp all along the seam. It actually hurts along with being irritating. For the price of this, otherwise warm and comfy, that's a terrible aspect of this.<br />Also the listed care instructions say both hand wash only and then Just machine wash cold and tumble dry low. I can attest that washing it in the washer was fine, though it didn't soften up the stiff prickly seams.<br />I think while super cute, for the price it's not worth it unless you always wear a long sleeve under it.",1677607360965,0,false

3,Maybe the third time will be a charm if I can get one,"First one lasted 2 months and then the function knob stopped working properly, some functions worked but toast was completely broken and sometimes other functions would require 'jiggling' the knob to get the oven to run.<br /><br />I contacted the seller, after some back and forth and pictures (see attached photo showing knob in toast position, light on but power light on the left not illuminated and no heat).<br /><br />They sent a replacement, which arrived yesterday (2/13/22).  There was no sign of damage to the box or the packing materials, however the oven itself had 2 dings on the top left and right.  Additionally the rack would not site in the grooves, somehow the oven was damaged in a way that moved the inside part outward.  The styrofoam packing seemed undamaged, so I can only presume damage happened at the factory prior to packing.<br /><br />Customer service has been great, they're going to replace again.  I'll update this review after I've either had a working oven for 3 months, or given up on this item.<br /><br />I'm giving this 3 stars, while it worked it worked well enough.  Maybe the third time will be a charm.<br /><br />Update 2/16/23: 1 star, customer service is falling apart.  They wanted to send me a 'new rack that will fit' when the problem is the interior of the oven is bowed out.  A wider rack will not fit as the oven opening is the correct width, rack slides in but as soon as it's fully in the oven it drops.  The baking pan/trip tray have the same exact problem.<br /><br />Update 2/27/23: So far so good, third unit appears to be in good shape and functional.  Customer service was a bit of a challenge to deal with.  When they say they're going to send another unit, it doesn't seem like they even try until you ask about status later.  So you need to stay on top of them.<br /><br />Now I have 3 units, 1 that seems to work except toaster.  One where the interior is damaged so that the trays will not stay up.. and one (that latest) that seems to be fine so far.<br /><br />If this last one fails, I give.. I'll buy a more expensive unit from a more reputable manufacturer.  I've set myself a reminder to update this in a year.",1676380107697,6,true

It beats using a cutting board and a knife.  Or does it?  There are qualifications in the manual.  Lettuce must be crispy.  Tomatos cannot be included.  I used crispy iceberg lettuce and instead of shooting into the bowl, the lettuce gathered inside the cutting cone and had to be dug out with a fork.  The bell pepper was cut into tiny splinters by the cutting tool, I'd hate to see what the shredding tool does to bell pepper.  The resulting salad was more like cole slaw floating in lettuce juice.

K-Cup port makes the normal weak K-crap, but works as advertised.<br /><br />- Filling coffee basket too full will often overflow coffee grounds all over machine if you brew eight or more cups. Basket assembly impossible to fully clean without a vacuum if grounds overflow.<br /><br />-Once in a while, it will brew a few ounces into the carafe, then randomly switch and dispense to the k-cup port. An unplug/replug<br />cycle will usually fix it, but not always.<br /><br />- If water reservoir falls below an inch available, will not brew. Have to refill to above 1 in. of water, otherwise it simply will not work.

You will need to attach the metal band strap once it is in position. The magnets are there only to hold it in position while you attach the metal band. Will fall off without strap.<br />DOES NOT PUSH AIR!! Yep, do the math here folks, it's called conservation-of-energy in physics. Heat rises off the pipe to spin the blades like a windmill, then the blades spin at thermal equilibrium with the radiating heat. In other words, the heat coming off the pipes is what is spinning the blades, so the blades are being pushed by the rising heat and therefore the blades push no air. The blades would need to spin faster than the rising heat to move hot air. You will need an external energy source (such as a battery/AC operated fan) to spin the blades faster than the rising heat off the pipe in order to get actual air movement.<br /><br />Misc<br />When I purchased this I was thinking they had figured out how to convert the thermal energy into a power source to drive the fan blades faster than the heat radiating from the surface.<br />Think of this fan like a windmill. The air movement spins the blades, so the blades move no air.<br /><br />Final note<br />The device actually probably does increase the amount of thermal/heat dissipation into the room as a heatsink, but the fan provides NO air movement and only functions as an aesthetic/novelty.",1672790606007,3,true

3,It's a nice little bag,"It certainly works fine for carrying stuff. Our state (Colorado) just changed to requiring us to bring in our own grocery bags or get charged a 10 cent fee so we got motivated to collect bags for this purpose. This bag is noticeably heavier than other bags we've bought for carrying groceries. It's also somewhat narrower than most of the other bags we have, partially because it has a zipper closure, which is nice if you want to carry items that you want to keep from falling out or protect from weather or thieves. We are from New York, so we were looking forward to the NYC design but it's dominated by a large American Flag, rather than the sights of NYC, which was disappointing. It also has the design on only one side.",1674437254896,0,false
3,Definitely not SEVEN colors.  More like THREE,"This is a cute clock, and the nightlight shines in a bunch of different colors, so that's cool.

That's fine, the clock works, but that's not what I bought it for.  I wanted the rainbow of pretty colors on the face of the clock.<br /><br />That's the negative.  The positives are that tou can adjust the brightness level for your comfort. It runs on batteries or using the enclosed USB charger, which includes a plug.

This pair….is disappointingly smaller, and you have to adjust a lever (that I couldn’t even find at first) to open and shut these things. It doesn’t open very far and doesn’t seem very sturdy. They are super cute, and would probably be fine if you’re hanging a towel on a line, or attaching a towel to your body, like the packaging says….(packaging says nothing about attaching to a chair, as it is stated in the description).

I don't mind that it is filled on the bottom, so you have to tip it upside down to fill. What I didn't like was the opening to fill the talk is WAY SMALLER than my old model. The old one I could fit my hand inside to clean/dry out. This one the hole is so small It barely allows my faucet to fit. I can't fill it in the bathroom sink. I have to use a cup to fill it, or walk all the way to the kitchen to fill it there. Not a good system. Even if you leave the small top off and turn it with the hole facing down, there is water left on the inside edges, so it never really dries out.<br />The new one made lots of boiling noise on high. So much, it would wake me at night. I think maybe it was defective, as a part of the tower was broken on mine when I opened it.

I have other memory foam pillows and gel seat cushions, and this pillow doesn’t have the same heft or feel. Since it is so light, it doesn’t stay in place on bed — and silk pillow slip makes it even worse.  I bought the standard size experimentally to see if I want to buy more, and decided I am not buying any more of these.

Also, the lid is scratched up.  The shipping box was fine and so was the carboard box for the item. I was going to return it, but the box itself is exactly what I wanted.

3,Slippery handle,"It is a pretty good product now that I modified it. The handle is more narrow at the top.

2,Small coil diameter,The coil diameter is less than 6 inches in diameter. Induction heats rapidly so applying 1800 watts on a 5.5 inch diameter area on the bottom of a 10 inch pan could create a small hot spot causing it to warp. The outer ring painted on the surface is about 8 inches in diameter suggesting a 10 inch pan could be used but I would not recommend a high heat setting. If you place a strong flashlight against the glass you can see the copper coil. The circles painted on the surface do not indicate coil size. There is room for a larger coil but the outer diameter of the coil holder has no wire in it. If you put water in the pan and turn up the heat you will see only a small circle is heated. Besides potentially warping the pan this will not cook evenly.<br /><br />The beeper is painfully loud.<br /><br />I like the sloped front design a lot more than the flat top units. I just wish it had a larger coil.,1678806535288,0,true

I'm trying to burn it off, but it's taking forever. It has good heat output but since the fan is so weak it doesn't spread the heat well enough.

3,Finding a good couch cover is not easy,"I have purchased too many couch covers over the years for different  pieces of furniture ( I like to frequently change things up) I have to say that this one has been one of my more successful covers. My couch fits the size/ dimiesensions provided but the ends do not quite go all the way to the floor allowing you to see more of the couch underneath. My current sofa also has a more rounded back rest versus a rectangle one so on my sofa the corners on the backrest are a little ill fitting. Again finding the 'perfect' couch cover seems almost impossible and this one has come pretty close. The color is beautiful and soft and not see through at all. When I removed it for its first washing there was a lot of shedding and beware wash the cover alone and the color will stain anything you wash it with, I was surprised though after the 1st wash the color did not fade at all. Over all I give this a solid 3 stars its a decent couch cover.",1678299281108,0,true

It is not properly balanced for the size of the cup; if you are drinking a hot liquid and want to avoid touching the sides of hot cup, you're only able to get one finger through the handle, and have to pick it up using limited hand muscles.

It is surprisingly dense and heavy – not something with which you’d like to be pummeled. Round, it isn’t particularly useful as a general pillow, so it becomes nothing more than a couch novelty – pointless. The toddler likes to kick it around, so there is that, but it doesn’t take long for the plush fabric to pick up any debris on the floor – and where there’s a toddler, there is debris.

3,Using vertically is not stable,"It is easy for anyone to assemble and keeps a messy cabinet tidy and organized. BUT... Originally I had it standing upright with pans on both sides. However, even though the bottom, (1st & 2nd) levels remain sturdy and flat, (as designed), the rest of the wire ""shelves"" can't keep the pans from drooping downward, no matter how small the pan is. The unit, (when used upright), is very unstable and wobbled quite a bit, even moreso when I actually took a pan out to use it. *Please note: I have average size/weight pans AND I was sure to place my heavier pots/pans on the very bottom since those shelves are both supported.<br />The only way I could use this was by putting the pot stand on its side. Unfortunately it reduced the storage space by half since I could only use one side. I ended up having to place my pans vertically with their handles pointing upward. Due to this specific configuration, it can only accommodate the slim shape of a pan so I couldn't even use it to store my pots. They had to be stacked on top of each other NEXT TO the very unit I purchased to hold/organize them. 🤦🏼‍♀️IMHO, the only way to safely use this is to place it in the horizontal configuration.

(Good luck!) Then alternate cold n hot (good luck!) it will not open. GET out the thinest blade possible trying to separate it at the joint. (Good Luck!) Now repeat all 3 steps while praying. In short: Refilling is a total pain in the a-- because the pull apart opening sucks, sticks together as if glued.<br /><br />  --Next: the connecting stems that hold the top parts together are impossible to clean around --even with a tooth brush. this simple unit requires tedious, unnecessary, time consuming work.<br /><br />I hope someone redesigns this.

Also the outside corner of the one top shelf I received was damaged. I just put it together broken and messaged the seller asking for a replacement board as there's NO WAY I'm taking this thing apart and assembling another one. It's a great concept for a desk but very poorly designed with low quality materials but my 12 year old likes it at least.<br /><br />UPDATE:Seller replied within 24 hours of messaging them about the problem and offered a partial refund or exchange of the product as they dont have the individual part that was broken.,1672975598946,1,true

Thinking that the original unit may may lost it's (hold-down) strength, over time, I replaced it with (this) purchase (of the exact same item) and to my amazed disappointment, the new OXO paper-towel holder behaves the exact same way. Still allowing me to tear off two or three sheets, when it's my intention to tear off just one. So, all-in-all, this Oxo Paper-Towel holder, is, in my opinion, (1) a total waste of money, (2) Creates more waste than it saves (3) is bad for the environment (creating unnecessary paper-towel waste) and also bad for my pocket book, so to speak!

It’s also nice that the entire lid locks closed while blending. I honestly believe I could walk away and let it blend without worrying about the lid flying off and making a mess. However, sometimes I get chunks in my smoothie. There’s nothing I can do but remove the lid and try to stir things around. I also find the blade to be very tough to clean. If you turn it upside down, it gets a bunch of food trapped in a hole that I cannot fit my finger into. The clean up is a headache!

2,A hot mess!,"It's a good idea to have a lunch container that can warm up your food and have it be piping hot when you want to eat it. This has a car charger and a regular electrical plug for a wall outlet. I don't have access to a microwave for lunch so I thought this would solve the problem with bringing leftovers to work for lunch. Because of the heating unit, the food container and bag it comes with is very large for a lunch box and it is close to being impractical. There is a rubber plug to put in the food stores section to prevent leaks but it seems looser than it should be and the hole is too large so you can't bring any soup or wet food in this unless you're positive it will stay upright. Unfortunately, my work vehicle won't charge the heating unit unless the engine is running which doesn't work too well for me. The rubber plug is small and very easy to lose and I may have already lost it. Hopefully, it's just hiding somewhere in my work van. The instructions say if you accidentally leave the plug in while the container is heating the food, it will damage the plug. Overall, this was just a hot mess and I won't be using it.",1674495316748,0,false

It's now dead and thrown away, but when I did have it, here are my thoughts. 1. It's hard to clean and the lid is difficult to get off. The lid is totally flat and you have to use your fingernail to try to get between the lid and the body to get it open. Not nice first thing in the morning. 2. The metal spring piece is a pain in the rear to get in the right place. You have to stick your whole hand into the body to get it where it goes. It has to be taken out each time and cleaned, and the hot milk film on the inside of the body also has to be cleaned. You have to put your whole hand down inside to clean that milk off. Only the bottom gets warm, not the sides.  3. If you don't put that little metal spring piece back on just right, it will not froth. Just so you know.  4. It quit working in about a year, and I only used it once, maybe twice a week because it was too much of a pain to clean and to get the lid off.  I expect Bodum products to last more than a year. It cost me a dollar every time I used it (based on the price, using it perhaps at most twice a week), definitely not worth it.",1676050576069,0,true

2,It’s a microwave steambox,"This microwave is hard to love. From the beginning, I was impressed with the inner metal casing. It was almost mirror-like.<br /><br />Then, the first major drawback is that you could only set the microwave using 30 second intervals. Mostly all tv dinners have instructions for 1100 watt microwaves. This is a 1000 watt microwave. Converting cooking time is so much harder because you would have to overcook, undercook or try to just stop it manually.<br /><br />I can’t say that I am fond of the LED Light. BECAUSE OF THE STEAM. This microwave is a little steambox. And I mean this literally. Every time the microwave is used it forms an overabundance of steam. It’s so much steam that you cannot see your food, literally. And the LED light doesn’t help. Not sure if halogen would’ve made a difference.<br /><br />After using the microwave, the inside is sweltering. It is unbelievable. I was perplexed. Am I supposed to wipe all the accumulated water inside EVERY TIME I use the microwave? Am I even supposed to wipe it at all? The manual doesn’t mention the excessive steam that accumulates and how to address it.<br /><br />I never even got around to using the convection features. Because I just couldn’t get past the microwave disappointments. This is totally not worth it. This is surely the worst microwave that I’ve ever purchased.<br /><br />Maybe the excessive steam is a consequence of mixing a microwave with an air fryer and convection.",1675844236128,2,true

2,"Easy to Install, but don’t bother","I just installed a propane 30,000 BTU Dyna-Glo in my finished basement.  It’s 1800 sf of one space in an L shape.  I need to raise the temperature  about 15° on days when it’s below 32° F outside.  If it’s warmer out, I need to raise about 8-10°.<br /><br />The heater works well for the space, but bc it’s large, I added this fan to disperse the air better.<br /><br />It’s very simple to install, knock out the rear panel that’s held on by four small welds, then set it in place and screw in four tiny bolts with washers.  It fits well and was installed in about two minutes.<br /><br />I added an outlet right below the heater, so the cord isn’t really an issue for me, though it could be less than attractive if it had to go across the wall to a plug or extension cord.  Cord is black and very heavy duty, more than this little fan could possibly require.  Perhaps that’s for heat protection, though.<br /><br />Once it’s on, though, it really doesn’t do any good.  I see absolutely minimal difference between it running and when I turn it off.  Like another reviewer, I put a piece of towel in front to visually verify what I felt.  Nothing changed. Holding it different ways and turning fan off and I on, the only movement I ever got from the paper towel was the updraft of the hot air rising.<br /><br />With only the heater on, holding my phone 1’ in front of top, I get 39 decibels.  With the fan on, I get 57 decibels. So it’s not very loud, but it’s also not doing any or at most, very little good.<br /><br />Skip this one and just enjoy your heater.  I guess I’ll just be adding to two or three ceiling fans to the basement to keep the air moving.",1673307271496,2,true

The green ""ready"" light DOES NOT WORK properly at all!!!  It comes on and goes off intermittently all throughout the preparation and cooking sessions with zero relationship to being ready for either the pour batter in mode or the waffle being done mode...This means you must do with this unit that has controls which are supposed to govern these aspects, what you must do with the bare bones stripped down units with no controls whatsoever: constantly open and check progress, which nullifies the whole point of having controls to begin with.<br />3. This unit does not cook waffles nearly as quickly or as well as my old unit with no controls. It also does not crisp the outer layer of the waffle at all and even if you turn up the temperature control and/or leave the waffle in longer to gain some brownness, the waffle still comes out limp and very soft.<br />Truly a disappointment.",1677514552029,0,true

The instructions say to turn it upside down which makes more sense since the blades will then be under the ingredients. However, you may actually need to shake it while blending and run it up to six or more of the 40 second cycles to get it all blended well.

2,Break faster than other brands,"We've had these for not even 2 years and we've had 2 plates now break while we were hand washing them, slicing our hands open, without touching anything but a dish scrubber. They've been used exactly to their instructions and our last plate set lasted us 8 years with nothing more than a chip, we just wanted to redesign getting these but they have certainly missed the mark on durability",1678066508720,0,true
2,Half of mine in the box did not work. The batteries were already dead!,"Half of mine in the box did not work. The batteries were already dead! Unfortunately I need this size, so I'm going to haft to buy another box of them. The price has also gone up!! Gggrrrr! 🤬",1672775333365,1,true

2,"Good chair, but poor instructions and dirty out of the box","Overall good chair, but 2 issues to why i rated low:<br /><br />(1) Install - instructions were terribly written & confusing.  Wrong screws directed to be used for armrest to backrest connection.  I had to go back to remove the instructed incorrect screws & change them out long after I had moved on.  Instructions were written in english,  but obvious that it was translated from a different language<br /><br />(2) Star foot was dirty out of the box - rust or corrosion colored stain on the plastic part (see picture)",1673741827236,0,true
2,VERY flimsy!,"I like that you can see through them and the door opens in the front.  However, these are a waste of money.  They will collapse if not treated with kid gloves!  Meaning handle very gently.  The door is also very small and hard to get shoes into.  My grandson wears a size 6 and that will be as big as they will hold.",1676001538424,0,true
2,Lets loose tea into the cup...,"Not so happy with this item...  It arrived on time, and packed well, however when I pulled it out of the plastic bag, the hanger chain was not connected to the tea holder.  I reconnected it by slipping a chain link into the very small, and lightly made hanger ring, and then loaded it with tea, and added it to a cup.  Small bits of the loose tea started to leak out of the holder, and into the hot water.  Not a very good tea brewing device in my opinion.  I will be returning these items to Amazon...",1674869587054,1,true
2,Broke day one,Tried to pull off the utensil drying park to scrub it and the plastic just completely broke and is ruined. No fixing it. I was trying to remove it to clean and scrub the whole unit separately but it was cheaply made and just snapped.,1674515010967,0,true
2,Noisy,Product shipped with a broken arm.  Lorell did promptly ship a replacement arm.  All was well the first few months but then reclining mechanism got noisier and noisier and fabric on back of seat split.,1676239013888,0,true
2,Hardly any smell,"I was excited to get these as they had some wonderful sounding fragrances. You are suppose to cut the contents of each package into 4 pieces using one piece at a time, good for up to 40 hours.<br />While I could get faint whiffs, there was very little smell. I ended up using a whole container. There still wasn’t enough of a smell for me.<br />I don’t want to be overwhelmed with fragrance but I would like to be able to have a pleasant smell when I walk into a room. I admit that I was disappointed and won’t buy them again.",1677277469422,0,true
2,Interior of this fryer is rusting so quick,Got this Ninja Fryer as a part of thanksgiving deal (nov 2022)  and initially it was very convenient and easy to use - but the rust formation inside the furnace is giving me second thought - don’t know if it’s safe to use this any further - had a good ride for 2-3 months - beyond this - unfortunately it’s a wrap !,1678657327944,0,true

2,Very cute .. but stops at cute,"update: awesome customer service! this did not work well for vacuuming my carpeted stairs, which is why I bought it. however, it does a pretty good job at vacuuming up crumbs on a hard floor and the occasional spider.<br /><br />Since I am quite happy with the eufy robo vac, I purchased a eufy for vacuuming carpeted stairs. I wouldn’t mind the time it took if it had good suction. I had to vacuum over and over just to get a little spec. Is there something wrong with it? So many reviews speak of great suction - ?? And the battery went dead before I finished a flight. Very disappointed and now too late to return.",1675310270659,0,true
2,Could be cute if made better,"I just wanted a simple St. Patrick’s Day sign for my wall, and this shamrock and signage seemed cute so I ordered it. The first one (in the third and fourth pics) had a shiny/darker patch on it, like the shellac spilled. Amazon being awesome Amazon, I easily ordered a replacement, which just arrived. Much to my chagrin, it’s even worse! As you can see in the first and second pics, it has the odd markings in three different places. If I had gotten these at a dollar store, I would accept the poor quality, but for this price, it’s unacceptable. I’m giving 2 stars because it is the size they say, it’s 1/4” thick MDF so it isn’t flimsy, and I like the lovely greens, but the flaws stand out way more in-person, especially when the sun is out, so back they both go.",1676929299894,0,true

2,Defective,I've owned other Update SS pans that were good. This one has some flaws. First the handle shape makes it hard to grip especially when full of hot boiling liquid. Second water gets into the handle and drips all over the floor after washing the pan. It's especially bad after being in the dishwasher.,1675211656957,0,true

2,"Love it, but!!",This air fryer does a great job!! BUT the controls are touch sensors and they don’t respond well to the touch. I find myself getting very upset because I can’t set the time and temperature! I’ve tried everything and it’s just not a good working touch panel. You can tap and touch all you want and it’s not going to work correctly. It really is a shame because otherwise it works great! So sadly because it’s so frustrating and difficult to use it’s a fail. There is an app to control it but who wants to have to get the app up just to heat a quick snack.,1676852518841,3,false

2,Uncomfortable to walk on,"I like how these rugs look and they are easy to put in the wash, but it’s almost painful to walk on them. The fabric is so thin I can feel all the stitching lines when I step on them,  it’s like walking on lines of sharp rope.",1678544673604,0,true
2,Material pulls easily,"I only downgraded this to 2 stars because after the first wash the material had some pulls in it, and I just kind of though “eh, that happens with silks” but after the second wash it’s much worse and I don’t think this will last for more than a few washes.<br />It’s really disappointing because the material is so soft and my hair has been less crazy in the mornings and my face isn’t as creased (cotton pillows leave deep marks on my face in the morning since I’m a stomach sleeper).<br />For the price, this one isn’t worth it.",1676004689948,0,true
2,Loved the scent in store but were out of stock,This particular product seemed like it was old and lost its scent. It also felt like it was only half full when I received it like someone had already used some of it. Disappointed.

2,15 days later the picture is peeling.,"Where my son lives this mug and the colors do pop out with heat really well, I gave it to him for Christmas and the picture is already peeling. It's January 9 as of the date on this review. The mug was never put directly in the microwave or the dishwasher. It was hand washed with a soft brush and dish soap to clean the hot cocoa residue off and sterilize after use. I gave it 2 stars because he did love it and it did do it's job, it just didn't last long at all.",1673270641303,0,false
2,Pretty underwhelming for the price,"I expected this to be better quality for the price. The design itself is super cute, but there are conspicuous white dots and lines cutting across the front, as well as light scratches throughout. The central image looks fine, but the flaws really stand out against the thick, dark blue border.<br /><br />It's also a bit weak for such a large magnet. I tested it with various things, and while it can easily hold a single sheet of paper, it's not quite strong enough for multiple layers or photographs. I think it will still make a lovely present for the Peanuts fan in my family, but I do feel it's overpriced for a single magnet that's pretty mediocre all around.",1673726740496,0,true
2,Do yourself a favor and upgrade!,"Parts of the set are great but the reason I bought this was for the cake spinner- I wanted to really get the icing perfect and smooth for a cake I was making. When i opened the box I thought “oh this is great - has a smooth spin and will work”. Well when I actually USED it the weight of the small cake ( 1, then 2 6-inch rounds wouldn’t allow the flimsy plastic spinner to do it’s job and spin!  Disappointed and can’t return without the box.<br /><br />If you’re looking for this so all the extras, cool buy it. But if the main purpose is for icing a cake with a cake spinner, do with a more expensive, heavy duty one.",1675217242090,0,true
